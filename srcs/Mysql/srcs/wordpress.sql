is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories that are lesser-known.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Embrace Who You Are and Your Journey</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this People of WordPress contributor story, we chat to Tyler Lau from the US on his relationship building work in marketing and his WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to discover his story which shows it is often what you have learned from negative experiences in your life that can make you a major asset to a product team.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-thumb.jpg?resize=632%2C464&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tyler Lau stood in front of a colorful mural\" class=\"wp-image-10116\" width=\"632\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-thumb.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=640%2C470&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-thumb.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=640%2C470&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>An Entrepreneurial Mindset</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler recalls he always had a knack for spotting a enterprise ideas. As an industrious seven-year-old, he was already finding ways to make sales during the school breaks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many entrepreneurs have similar stories, Tyler’s path took many turns before he discovered and thrived in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was drawn to both the software and the community that surrounds it from his search for personal and professional freedom. He ultimately was able to combine his various business interests and people skills into professional marketing work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Using your skills to uncover your journey</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-2.jpg?resize=632%2C758&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tyler Lau pictured sat on a chair using his mobile phone in his social media work\" class=\"wp-image-10118\" width=\"632\" height=\"758\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-2.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=640%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-2.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=640%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler’s current role is as a Marketing Relationship Builder, based in Kansas, USA. His responsibilities span across all digital properties and products, leveraging his broad set of business and people skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These skills are amplified by his creativity and adaptability. Tyler says that one reason he is always looking for new projects is his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a diagnosis he received in 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an industry built by programmers and developers who often have a strong sense of focus, Tyler felt that someone with ADHD wouldn’t be seen as a natural fit. He found the WordPress community to be a place where everyone can find the right spot for their unique skills. Tyler’s skill is people, and this has translated into many opportunities and responsibilities in his work life. His skills have also helped him give back to the WordPress community as a speaker and volunteer, and through multiple contributor days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Relationship-building as a career</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of Tyler’s experience was in the restaurant industry, and his resume did not exactly point to a career in tech. But the service industry actually prepared him well for everything he has taken on since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he is at work events, he meets people from across the world and builds connections with them. As an extrovert, he enjoys this and couldn’t imagine a job where he was isolated from getting to know others and relationship-building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding people and being able to operate in any setting are key competencies. Social skills and tact are useful for community building in the WordPress space too, and in Tyler’s life at different times it has been necessary for survival. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The true meaning of freedom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the WordPress community, the concept of freedom comes up often. WordPress is built on GPL, free software, and open-source values. Practically speaking, anyone can work remotely or be their own boss to gain more freedom in work and life.&nbsp;Tyler feels that he never fitted into a traditional work mould. With his strong focus on freedom, he found this resonated with the freedom and opportunities he believes WordPress provides him and thousands of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler describes how in 2013 his ‘inner opportunist’ got him into trouble. After dropping out of college following a brain aneurysm, he needed capital to fund his first startup.&nbsp;He shares that he found a quick but unlawful way to make money. Alongside this between shifts as a waiter, he worked on prototypes for his first product. The company was growing fast, and to protect his patents and take research and development to the next level, he had to work hard. Everything came to a halt when some of the actions he took resulted in being sent to prison.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says that meeting other inmates reminded him that he was in a much better situation than most. He was educated, well-off, loved, and knew he had a future once he was released. He found that many inmates never graduated from high school and were computer illiterate. While inside, Tyler taught subjects like science, math, writing, reading, and social studies. He found that due to the lack of skills and support, many inmates would struggle upon release. He believes getting the mental health support and job training needed to thrive after prison is not easy for many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>There’s more to freedom than just being on the outside. You also need a sense of agency and enfranchisement,</em>” says Tyler. He considered his sense of purpose and support network were plenty to keep him going and was ready to take on his next (legal) business challenge as soon as he could.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Going forward positively&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/FF50DF21-38AA-4778-B465-C2DF0B441AD7.jpeg?resize=632%2C632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tyler Lau portrait picture\" class=\"wp-image-10139\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/FF50DF21-38AA-4778-B465-C2DF0B441AD7.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/FF50DF21-38AA-4778-B465-C2DF0B441AD7.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/FF50DF21-38AA-4778-B465-C2DF0B441AD7.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea that your past doesn’t define you and you can choose to embrace it, is a key driver for Tyler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He describes himself as an outlier in many ways. He recalls how politics influenced his life from the day he was born. Tyler’s father is a semi-dissident Chinese visual anthropologist, his mother is an art professor who left her home country of Japan to break free from traditional Japanese gender roles. Tyler feels he inherited a lot of this fearlessness.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>I’ve never fitted in, and yet this is what makes me able to adapt to most situations and relate to just about anyone. I embrace my eclectic, dissonant past and see beauty in the person those experiences shaped me to be</em>,” says Tyler.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, he’s able to put those skills to good use in the WordPress community and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says: “<em>Regardless of your physical abilities, mental health struggles, upbringing, and even your run-ins with the law, no one is excluded from carving their place in the WordPress industry</em>”.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tyler Lau (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/tylermaximus/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>tylermaximus</a>) for sharing his #ContributorStory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\">@lmurillom</a>), Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>), Olga Gleckler (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/oglekler/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>oglekler</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>yvettesonneveld</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>) for working on the People of WordPress series.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y3odYTyvSfJbVxUxUWEgKxOprox2zxVwhk7_vdW-AIs4IlE-jK0Zt1itCj867x0dIAbIiK-VeuTLMZr6BjNEY0fkTf--4dT1hkLbnGtsPFNfyrVBYIN59IirTkNnqiQgqxk6E1MI\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\"><em>Topher DeRosia</em></a><em>.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first episode of this podcast, I said that there&#8217;s a lot that goes into WordPress, that&#8217;s really hard to see. One of the hardest things to see about the WordPress project as you get started is the overall structure. There is quite a bit of documentation that can clarify the basics: the names of teams, what they work on, and where, and when they meet. The way that they influence and support each other can really feel like a bit of a mystery. So today, I&#8217;m going to break down the WordPress community into five big groups; I want you to keep a couple of things in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, these are high-level and based on my observations. Each of these groups can be further broken down into subgroups. So while you may not feel represented in this exact five, you are included if you were to dig a little bit deeper. The second thing to keep in mind is that the makeup of these groups is pretty fluid. Many community members find themselves in more than one group, but generally not far off. Some group two folks end up in group three, depending on the situation, people in group four can also end up in group five, and so on. As with so many things that I share, I&#8217;m not trying to insist that one size fits all. I&#8217;m not trying to put the WordPress community into a box. This is just a basic framework to understand how it all fits together. Alright, are you ready? I&#8217;m ready. Let&#8217;s do it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I have a broad definition of the community, which I have mentioned before. I believe that the community is anyone who has interacted with WordPress, whether they know it or not. So, I&#8217;ll start from way out there and work my way in that first group; we’re going to call our <strong>Visitors</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visitors</strong> are people who arrive at a WordPress site to gain information or engage in an activity. Sometimes they know it&#8217;s a WordPress site, but most of the time, they don&#8217;t. The second group are <strong>Users</strong>, people who use WordPress as their CMS. So, that&#8217;s website builders, website designers, small businesses, content creators, and the list goes on and on. The third group I like to refer to is the <strong>Extenders</strong>. Those are people who extend WordPress through the creation of blocks, themes, plugins, and more. There are also people who teach WordPress to others through WordPress podcasts, and newsletters and tutorials. The fourth group I refer to as our <strong>Contributors</strong> is the people who contribute to the open source software and the infrastructure supporting it, but not necessarily the same people who contribute directly to their own product. And then there&#8217;s group five, <strong>Leaders</strong>. Those are people who help drive the vision and strategy for WordPress; the most notable member of that group is of course, Matt Mullenweg. And I&#8217;m also in that group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these groups directly influenced the groups on either side. For example, a WordPress user is affected by both visitors and extenders. Imagine a content creator who shares their passion for photography through a WordPress site; this photographer may have visitors that need to purchase photos. In response, the user now has a need to make it possible for visitors to purchase photos on a site. So they go to what we consider the extenders, people who have built a plugin that supports that need. And as a result, that user can install that on their site. And they have have satisfied the need of the visitors to their site, the people who now can purchase photos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of examples like this in the WordPress project. Every small pattern that you see is mirrored in the larger patterns across our ecosystem. And every large pattern you see in the ecosystem can be seen among our teams. It&#8217;s pretty cool to look at really. So, why should this matter to you? From a very practical standpoint, this matters for anyone who&#8217;s trying to learn more about contributing to the WordPress project. These five groups mirror very closely the five steps of volunteer engagement that we see across the ecosystem and from a more philosophical standpoint, it&#8217;s just kind of nice to know who your neighbors are. Without the influence and support of the groups around us, it can be hard to know whether we&#8217;re on the right track or not. So take a look to your left and look to your right, and get to know your partners in this project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our community highlight, the segment where I share a note about contributors who have helped others along the way, or WordPress success story. This week&#8217;s highlight is from @CoachBirgit, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/coachbirgit/\">Birgit Olzem</a>, a longtime contributor and a friend of mine. Her success story goes like this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has allowed me as a mother of five to leave a toxic marriage for good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, the community picked me up when I became seriously ill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can say from the bottom of my heart, that working with WordPress has saved my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got three things for you this week. I think that they&#8217;re all very important. And I hope you check them all out. The first one is a reminder that word camp Central America is coming up on April 15 and 16th. If you have not registered for tickets, you still have time, I will share a link to the registration page and the schedule in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list of big things is that the Gutenberg 10.4 release is coming out later this week on April 14th. It&#8217;s an important release because it&#8217;s when we take a look at the current iteration of full site editing tools that we have, and decide if it&#8217;s ready to get into the WordPress 5.8 release. There&#8217;s a post that has a little more information about that which I will share in the show notes below as well. If you haven&#8217;t checked out the Gutenberg plugin lately, obviously I think it&#8217;s a good idea to do that in general, but definitely a good idea to check it out now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing on our list today is a reminder to check out our most recent block pattern tutorial, I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes. It&#8217;s this kind of tips and tricks, tutorial, the “show me how to do it,” kind of thing in the style of <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-style-guides/\">CSS-Tricks</a>. If you or anyone that you know might be interested in sharing a similar style of tutorial, there&#8217;s a link to a form in that show notes as well so that you can share with us your name and the topic that you&#8217;re interested in. We&#8217;ll take a look and see if it&#8217;s something that we definitely need to make sure our users know how to do. So, that my friends is your small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

They&#8217;re pretty nice, useful shortcuts when you know them, but there&#8217;s a good chance you may not know what they are or why you might want to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s a block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are&nbsp;<strong>collections of pre-arranged blocks</strong>&nbsp;that can be combined and arranged in many ways making it easier to create beautiful content. They act as a head-start, leaving you to plug and play with your content as you see fit and be as simple as single blocks or as complex as a full-page layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=632%2C414&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10021\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=1024%2C670&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=768%2C503&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=1536%2C1005&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=2048%2C1340&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They live in a tab in the block library.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks theme</a> (which is a fancy name for &#8220;TwentyTwentyOne Blocks&#8221;) stores images in the theme library.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now what?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing about a block pattern is, as soon as you insert it from the block library, it stops being <em>a cohesive unit</em> — now it&#8217;s just a smattering of blocks, detached from the pattern you created and meant to be customized to your liking. It&#8217;s a <em>shortcut</em>, not a <em>template</em>. That also means you don&#8217;t have to worry about switching themes or deactivating pattern plugins: the blocks you already inserted won&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, if you like this one pattern so much you want to use it again and again, with no customization at all, you can make it into a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/gutenberg-tutorial-reusable-blocks/\">reusable block</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls loop src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/reusable-block.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks are created, as the name implies, to be reused. The feature is a great way to store small bits of commonly used snippets that you can edit in one place to update in all. &#8220;<strong>Follow me on Twitter</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Article series</strong>,<strong>&#8220;</strong> or <strong>&#8220;Subscribe to my podcast&#8221;</strong> are great examples of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What makes a good block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns, as they ship today, are limited by the features available. If the block editor doesn&#8217;t allow you to customize letter-spacing, your block pattern can&#8217;t either.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [0:41]: This month, we have a bonus briefing, so I&#8217;ve asked my dear friend and colleague <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a> to join me. Matías was recently called “the spark behind the vision of Gutenberg.” With full site editing coming our way in 202, I asked if he would join me for a quick Q&amp;A. Welcome, Matías.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [0:56]: Hello, hello! Thanks for inviting me. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [1:00]: Well, I&#8217;m delighted to have you. And I think that we have a lot of excellent questions. All right, so Matías, we actually ended up with questions in about three different groupings. And so I&#8217;m going to start with the “what is it about full site editing,” sorts of questions that people had. We&#8217;re gonna work our way into “what are we doing with it?” and then “how are we planning on getting this out the door?” Then, a couple of big picture questions that people asked. We&#8217;re just gonna leap right in this full site editing part of the Gutenberg plugin, or is it a standalone plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [1:39]: Okay, we&#8217;ll start with the basics. Full site editing is part of the Gutenberg plugin right now. I think it&#8217;s important to mention that full site editing is like an umbrella for several projects that we&#8217;re working on. They are all aiming to bring blocks into more parts of your site so that editing becomes easier and more expressive, and so on. So full site editing right now encompasses adding a ton of new blocks. I think we have around 20 new blocks coming in, including navigation query, site, title, logo, etc. There&#8217;s also the interface to interact with templates outside of the content; that&#8217;s another big part of the full site editing project. We also have a lot of new design tools included, many of these have been released in previous major releases, but they still comprise a strong part of what full site editing is. We also have something called Global Styles, which aims to allow people to configure the visual aspects of blogs across the entire site, not just on any individual blog. And of course, then there&#8217;s a whole layer of how we utilize these tools. It can get complex because there are many layers and projects that need to come together. So yeah, all of these are accessible through the Gutenberg plugin right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [3:07]: Yeah. So it&#8217;s not a standalone plugin. If you wanted to check out full site editing the site editor experience as it is now, you would just have to make sure you had the Gutenberg plugin on your site. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías: Yes, correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha:&nbsp; So a couple of the questions related to this are how exactly do I enable it on my site? And what is the easiest and safest way to try this on my site? And I think the answer is, is right in there. It&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. And so if you have that plugin, you don&#8217;t need the testing plugin or anything else to make that work, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [3:51]:&nbsp; No, you like, you might need to install a theme like Twenty Twenty One blocks that unlock some of these new interfaces that we just talked about. Like other of these pieces are available for anything. But some of these, like the interface to edit templates, right now only talk with things that know how to express their desire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [4:14]: And I think we have less than 10 themes right now that do that, but I&#8217;ll leave some links to at least 2021 blocks in the show notes. And then, if there are another one or two themes that I can find, I can add those in there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have to have the Gutenberg plugin; you have to have a theme that works with that site editor kind of experience. And then you&#8217;re safe to try everything out. It shows up in your left toolbar just like any other thing, like if you were working with plugins, or if you were adding a post or anything else, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [4:51]: Yes, correct. And so, some of these details are being worked on right now. Like how and where you access things, and so on. These things are subject to change, but right now, you have this site editor beta in the sidebar when both you have the plugin running and a theme that&#8217;s capable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [5:10]: Yeah. Excellent note. If you are running this on a production website, I would recommend you not do that unless you are very, very good with WordPress. It&#8217;s a really safe and easy thing to test and try out. But because it is still in beta, I recommend always putting it on a test site. I have a couple of different test sites that I run on myself. Another question that I had was, “will full site editing slow down my site?” And I think we have some refreshed performance tests coming out about that. And maybe they&#8217;ll be out by the time we publish this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [5:49]: Yeah, I mean, like the performance has been one of the major focuses for the whole project. In many cases, it should speed up things because we&#8217;re like, I think one of the big pieces that these projects bring into the picture, especially for themes, is that it allows only the necessary assets to be loaded on the front end. For example, if for a given page, there are, I don&#8217;t know, 10-15 blocks being used, you would only get the CSS and scrapes and so on related to those blocks. This can cut down on a lot a ton of CSS that themes used to end queue on a side, particularly if you were trying to customize many widgets and so on, like a lot of themes have the full styles or multiple widgets, even third party plugins, and so on. So one of the advantages of having this blog system is that we can know at the time of rendering what blogs are being used and only load those assets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [6:50]: Excellent. Another big question that we have is, “does full site editing work with the classic editor? And does it work with other builders?” I think that&#8217;s a really big answer if you&#8217;re going to get super deep into it. But I think that the short answer is yes, it does. Is that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [7:08]: Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it touches a bit on that full site editing is not like a single thing. There are multiple projects around it. So again, like the template editor that only deals with blogs, it doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do with a classic editor. But the classic editor use for both doesn&#8217;t change anything at all; like the same way that when the block editor was introduced, it didn&#8217;t change how you could still write posts in the classic editor. You will still be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [7:41]: And if you are brand new to WordPress person, or, I mean, I guess at this point, you don&#8217;t have to be super brand new. If you&#8217;re fairly new to WordPress person and have no idea what we&#8217;re talking about when we say the classic editor, you don&#8217;t really have to worry about it either. You don&#8217;t have to go and find out what that is; the block editor that you have right now works perfectly for what you&#8217;re trying to do. So if you don&#8217;t know what I mean when I say classic editor, don&#8217;t worry about chasing it down either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that this last question we accidentally answered earlier, but I&#8217;m going to go ahead and ask it anyway since I received it. “I keep hearing that you can use the site editor with the 2021 theme. But I don&#8217;t seem to be able to. What am I missing?” I think the answer is that there&#8217;s the Twenty Twenty One theme shipped with the WordPress release 5.6. And then there is the Twenty Twenty One blocks theme; those are two different themes. The link to the Twenty Twenty One block theme is going to be in our show notes this time around. And so, if you have been trying to use the full site editor with Twenty Twenty One and not succeeding, try the link to the one below. And I bet that that will work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [8:50]: Yes, that&#8217;s correct.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [8:51]: All right, excellent. Well, that brings us kind of into our second set of questions, which is about how we are doing it. The first one that folks have is “will full site editing be on by default in the next release. In this context, the next release is WordPress 5.8. But I think it&#8217;s a safe question to ask if full site editing will be on by default in the release that it&#8217;s planned for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [9:15]: Yeah, and for this, I need to go back to the same principle of many projects because there are many pieces of full site editing, and we have been merging them in major releases, particularly like the blocks and the design tools. There are more coming in that we want to make accessible as soon as possible. The full experience that requires a theme to opt-in to templates using blogs won’t be by default; it requires a specific theme running. A lot of these details we&#8217;re still like determining exactly what projects are ready to be merged and so on. But yeah, if you have a theme right now that works the way you want, it doesn&#8217;t change anything there. If anything, it adds some more capabilities and more customization tools, and so on. And the theme can also regulate how much they want to incorporate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [10:13]: Matías, you&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times in this podcast so far like this is a really complex and really complicated part of this work. And just for anyone out there who&#8217;s either encountering Gutenberg or full site editing or this podcast for the first time, I think a tiny bit of context that&#8217;s worth having here is that Matías and I have been working on this together in various capacities for like, five years. And Matías has probably been working on this for practically a decade. So, when we say that this is a really complicated problem, and when we say that this is a complex set of issues that we&#8217;re working with like, it is all that we have been thinking about for I want to say at least the last three or four years, but certainly it&#8217;s all that we have been trying to untangle for quite a bit of time before that as well. So we don&#8217;t take it lightly when we&#8217;re like, “this is complicated;” we mean it. It&#8217;s really complicated. And we&#8217;re trying our hardest over here as WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next big question, since we&#8217;re all stuck in the “it&#8217;s very complicated,” part of things is the question, “will this update break my current site?” Like, if I have a site that is updated and ready, and it&#8217;s exactly as I wanted it to be, and it took me two years to get there will full site editing, whichever release it&#8217;s in. Currently, 5.8 is what we&#8217;re planning for. Will that break anything on my site as I know it right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [11:44]: No, not at all. One of the major things that the WordPress team, the WordPress community, always cares so much about, never to break things. Many of these things are stepping stones that you can adopt, as we&#8217;ve talked about full site editing. But for example, we also have a few concurrent projects around the widget screen and the navigation screen that are meant to bring blocks into existing interfaces. So again, the theme doesn&#8217;t need to change, and a lot of care is being put into making this more like you&#8217;re unlocking new features, and nothing really breaks or falls apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [12:23]: This update, like all the other updates, should have minimal, minimal impact on what you have to actively fix on your site. Every once in a while, a bug is gonna get by. We can&#8217;t say that we&#8217;re 100% perfect with not breaking things. But also, we always and I and I know that we&#8217;re planning on this for our remaining releases for the rest of the year. At the very least, I can&#8217;t imagine we&#8217;d ever change it. But after every major release, we always make a plan to have a minor release within the next one or two weeks. Because we know that a broken thing on a site is really incredibly impactful, even if you&#8217;re only 1% of the sites that had that happen to it. And so I think that&#8217;s true in this case, too. And getting that feedback back from all of the people who are actually using WordPress is the thing that makes us be able to kind of move quickly when we do see those problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the questions that we have been getting is, “can I see a live preview without saving the changes that I made?” When I got this question, I didn&#8217;t actually understand it. And so I went and looked at a site without the Gutenberg plugin on it, and then a site with the Gutenberg plugin on it. And of course, on sites without Gutenberg, without the block editor, without full site editing, when you are looking to preview, you have the option to open up your preview in a new window. And you don&#8217;t have that with Gutenberg because it&#8217;s supposed to be a true WYSIWYG editor. A true what you see is what you get, editor. I think that the answer to this is, yes, you can see a live preview without actually saving the changes on the front end of your site. But you don&#8217;t actually have to reload anything. You don&#8217;t have to open it up in a new window. You don&#8217;t have to, like, actively click “please show me a preview” because what you see in your editing screen should be what you see at the end of your app as an end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [14:28]: Yeah, that&#8217;s the sort of the main gist to it. Yes, the site editor is built so that it always reflects the front end as truly as possible, so that&#8217;s one layer. Also, the preview tools should allow you to see in different devices like mobile breakpoints, and I don&#8217;t know if they will have breakpoints and stuff like that. There are a lot of things in the current interface that is just not enabled. There are some challenges in the sidebar. Because the site editor is not just focused on a single post, it&#8217;s focused on the entire site. So, there can be many, many changes that need to be shadowed for the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re changing the site title, some of the global styles, aspects, and so on need to be orchestrated. So, to see in the previewing new window, there are some challenges there to integrate. Again, the interface is not final yet; a lot of these things are still being tweaked and improved. There are many things from the regular post editor that are not enabled yet. But they will be enabled. So yeah, it&#8217;s a, I guess, it&#8217;s not a simple thing to answer. Because, again, the idea of previewing the site that&#8217;s core to the whole project is that you&#8217;re always interacting in the same way that when you&#8217;re in the customizer, you&#8217;re seeing the preview all the time. That&#8217;s the main scope of this project,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [15:54]: Excellent. Changes like that changes to your workflow can be really hard to get your mind around, especially if part of that existing workflow was there to create some confidence in what you&#8217;re seeing with your users. And so I understand. Now that I&#8217;ve researched that question a bit, I see where that&#8217;s coming from. Based on existing workflows and existing patterns that we have for ourselves in WordPress, will we need to have a theme to use the full site editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [16:33]: I think we&#8217;ve already covered some of these. And again, they are tools that can work on any existing theme. There is other stuff that needs space-specific themes to opt-in into these tools, like blog templates and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [16:50]: Yes, I think the question that we have next, because I see that the literal next question I have is actually something we have covered; just because we&#8217;re being pretty conversational about it, not because anyone already asked the question. So I&#8217;m actually going to skip to the last question of this section that I received. I got this next one via Twitter. The question is, “how do you view the role of themes once full site editing is fully rolled out and all the page elements (content, headers, widgets, footers, etc.) and all the views are managed via blocks and block patterns? Will things become typographic and block styles?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [17:28]: I think this is a great question because it goes to the heart of, why are we doing all this. One of the main reasons is to empower users more. WordPress has been democratizing publishing for a while; this is another step into allowing themes to get more customization tools and more control over their site if they want to. I think the recent call for testing has focused on the 404 page, for example. That&#8217;s something that forever has been locked away from users. And it&#8217;s also something that, as a theme developer, and I used to develop themes a long time ago, that was one of the things where you decide what sort of approach you take for the 404 page. Maybe sometimes you want to have something more whimsical. Sometimes you need something more serious. And committing to one when you can have such a diverse and broad user base can be challenging. With these, it becomes as easy as offering a few different patterns for that template. Then the user will always be able to change the copy and modify something. So again, it opens up a lot of these things that used to be locked down. However, from a theme perspective, I think this doesn&#8217;t reduce the theme at all. If anything, it allows the theme to focus less on coding and functions and more on design expression and aesthetics. I don&#8217;t think that would ever be exhausted. That will always remain as diverse as humans are interacting with WordPress. And so it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t see it&#8217;s just as like, typographic and block styles. How do you express a template, how do you express the structure, what choices you quote, what choices you make as a theme builder? And of course, there are many degrees of control there. Because a site maintainer may not want the 404 template to be editable, that sort of control will always be present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [19:38]: Yeah. And really fast. I have to add a caveat to a thing that you said in there. For anyone who&#8217;s listening keenly, you may have heard Matías say that the users can update any of the content there &#8211; any of the copy. In this context, we&#8217;re talking about users as in the people who are maintaining the site, not people who are visiting your site. Visitors to your site will not be able to change any copy on your page unless you&#8217;ve done something very interesting with your WordPress site, which is also fine if that&#8217;s what you prefer to do. By default, your visitors can&#8217;t change everything on your website, which is good news, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve got one logistics question, which I&#8217;m happy to take. And then one is kind of a big picture question that I also got from Twitter. “What about the classic editor block; what is going to happen to that? And when will we know?” So ages and ages ago, before COVID? I think so. Probably maybe a couple of years ago, Matt said that the classic editor plugin would be supported through the end of 2021. And that is still the case; there will be active support on that through the end of 2021. After that, it will not be actively supported anymore. It won&#8217;t be removed from any place that you can get access to right now. In a “this is the end of its lifecycle” sort of way, we just won&#8217;t have anyone who is currently committed to maintaining that plugin anymore. So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening at the end of the year. And yeah, at the end of 2021. The big question that we have is, “why is full site editing being so rushed?” I think this is a bit of a loaded question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [21:32]: Yeah, I think I think it&#8217;s still a fair question, though. I think we&#8217;re dealing with two things here. And one is ensuring that we release things in the best state possible. And also, some of the urgency is to offer tools that we know that people lack right now and that could really benefit from. Making that determination is very tricky. The full site editing project has been in the works for the last couple of years. If we count the initial phase of Gutenberg, that&#8217;s four to five years. We&#8217;ve been doing many calls for testing, which I think have been super useful to catch issues and reflect as a community on where things are going; how do we integrate with these? How do we use it? What are the shortcomings? What do we need to do? Based on all of these, we&#8217;ll continue to make decisions on when things become ready. We&#8217;re not committed to releasing something that&#8217;s not in a good state. And I think we will always be very careful about that. There are these two competing senses of the urgency &#8211; of getting some of these tools out, and because it also benefits from the feedback loops. I always say that, in many ways, the initial phase of Gutenberg, to me, is not finished. We took the initial two years to do the 5.0 release, the initial block editor, and so on. But, it&#8217;s still being improved at a very fast pace, among all the recent major releases improvements to the editor were included; that will continue to be the case. In many ways, phase one is not finished. And the moment we choose to release some of these tools or editing tools, it won&#8217;t be finished either. They will need to continue to grow, mature, and incorporate a lot of the feedback. Even the things that the ecosystem is building around. I&#8217;ve seen a few themes already that are incorporating a blank canvas template so that you can use them in some pages and take over and do everything with blocks. So even the community and ecosystem as a whole is also sort of paving the way for what needs to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [24:06]: I think from my perspective, and of course, I&#8217;m on the people side of things, the communication side of things, the logistics side of things; I have a frequently a very different view from what a lot of other folks are seeing. And so from my side of things, I have to say, I&#8217;m communicating about this change in a really broad way, which has not been happening since 2019 when we started the work. We&#8217;ve been communicating broadly with the WordPress community, but not with everybody who uses WordPress. So, I think that for a lot of people, this looks like a project that we started really actively working on in the last six months or so. And now we&#8217;re just racing toward a finish line. I think that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s not been a lot of awareness of everything that&#8217;s gone into it. And so, on the one hand, it feels a little less rushed to me knowing the full length of the history on this. But also, as you said, I really think that this gets a bunch of tools to people who otherwise have not been able to accomplish these things in WordPress or otherwise. I am so anxious to get something to people who really can benefit from this change the most. And it&#8217;s the nature of the open source, right that like, one, as long as you have users, you&#8217;re going to have stuff you have to fix in your software. So we&#8217;re never really, really going to be done with this; there&#8217;s not going to be like a done point of WordPress. And the second thing is, I think it&#8217;s generally true that you don&#8217;t really start getting full user feedback until after you have launched your major release. I think that we see that a lot in open source software; you can bring in as many people as you think you can in your user tests heading up to it. And in your accessibility tests. And, in general, quality assurance tests. You can bring in a lot of people and still not have gotten the full understanding of the various niche use cases that your users will bring to you. Because at this point, we&#8217;re like 40% of the web. And that means that we&#8217;re serving this majority collection of increasingly minority voices and niche voices in the space. And so, a little bit I feel a sense of urgency; I feel a bit of anxiousness about trying to get this out there for one, to get the tools in the hands of the people who can benefit the most from them, but also so that we can start really getting the full stress test of this software out and get that feedback in so that we can really build something responsive to what our users need our long tail, “anyone who ever uses WordPress ever,” definition of users. And so, that&#8217;s why I feel a sense of urgency around it. Even though you know, as I said, you and I have been working on this for like five years, and you&#8217;ve been working on it for a decade or something. I actually don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s been worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:35]: Now that makes me feel a bit old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [27:40]: Nobody makes Matías feel old. He is a lovely, wonderful colleague. Sorry, Matías, If I made you feel old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:46]: No, that&#8217;s totally fine. I also want to add that full site editing is not like a single toggle that&#8217;s going to drop into a major release. So I think that&#8217;s important to consider, I think this entire year is going to see a lot of these tools being, and sometimes the sort of the end-user is not the, again, the site maintainer. Still, you can also be the theme developer; I think there are many tools that would be empowering for theme developers to use. Again, we mentioned there are like five to ten themes, block themes right now. That needs to grow a lot, and that only grows through these sorts of feedback loops. And the theme community pushing things forward and seeing where things can lead to. I&#8217;m very excited about the pattern directory integration because I think that can also combine with blog themes in very powerful ways. Imagine if, I don&#8217;t know many of these patterns that are very common on the web and very needed, that if we can refine them together with a second community and make them available across themes, you can combine a header from one theme with a content of another; all these sorts of mixtures could happen. All of this needs exploration, the creativity of the entire community, and so on. In that sense, getting all these tools, even if it doesn&#8217;t immediately change anything for like the site itself, starts to unlock a lot of things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [29:27]: I&#8217;m going to take a bit of your answer from there and tie it all the way back to your first answer that we had when you joined me today. And say, I think you&#8217;re absolutely right. We have a set of users in our theme authors and our plugin developers as well that we desperately need to get looking at this set of tools. I hope that what we are shipping in the first iteration of this serves as an opportunity for all of those theme authors and agency owners, plugin authors, WordPress site configurers freelancers. Like, I really hope that this puts it into a really accessible, easy-to-access space for them so that they can do those experiments based on what they know their users need the most. They are the group that has the closest access to site maintainers. And what they need compared to, for instance, me or a potential you like we have a lot of information, you and I, we do a lot of tests, we have a strong sense of what is needed at the moment, but we don&#8217;t have as a close connection that our theme and agency and plugin folks all have. And so that&#8217;s another part of why I&#8217;m so excited to get this out in the current iteration of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:04]: That was a lot of questions in a little bit of time. This is going to be officially my longest WordPress briefing. Matías, I am so glad that you were able to join me today. And I think that everyone&#8217;s going to be really, really excited to hear your answers to these questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [31:23]: Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:25]: All right, my friends. That brings us into our small list of big things. I&#8217;m going to skip our community highlight today just because we had a slightly longer word press briefing in our bonus iteration today. But the small list of big things. The first thing is WordCamp Central America is coming up on April 15; there is a registration link in the show notes that you can access your tickets with. I recommend that you go; we&#8217;ve got a lot of excellent speakers coming up there and a lot of good content and good training and learning for y&#8217;all. The second thing is that Matt Mullenweg and I have listening hours coming up with the community in the first week of April. I&#8217;ll add the link to register for those in the show notes as well; it&#8217;s just a few minutes for you all to stop by, check-in, see what&#8217;s going on, and share some celebrations or concerns with us.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so last week, we wrapped up and shipped the WordPress 5.7 release. The release team this time around was smaller than we&#8217;ve had in the last couple of years. By the numbers, it looks really good: 66 enhancements or feature requests went in, 127 bugs were fixed, and seven versions of a Gutenberg plugin were merged and backported. If you use WordPress, you are probably aware that we have new releases throughout the year, but you probably don&#8217;t know much about the release process. There&#8217;s not really a reason to know unless you&#8217;re actively contributing to a release. For those interested in knowing more about how we improve WordPress, this week&#8217;s exploration is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna take a look at what goes into WordPress releases and just kind of zoom our way in from the highest level. At the highest level, there are three major WordPress releases a year, plus the minor releases, plus Gutenberg releases. So if you&#8217;re following current WordPress work and future WordPress work, that&#8217;s going to get you to probably around <strong>30 releases a year</strong>. If we zoom in one level to the release itself, a single release of WordPress takes four to five months from start to the day that we ship, and an additional four to six weeks on support and translations, and minor releases after that. If you&#8217;re looking from my vantage point, you&#8217;ll see that WordPress releases have essentially five parts, some of which happen kind of simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part is planning and includes the project lead, lead developers, design; groups like that. The second phase is the creation phase when we&#8217;re actually building the things that have to go into the CMS that involves the design, core, editor, mobile, and other teams. Then there&#8217;s this phase that I like to refer to as the distribution phase. This is mostly done by the teams that make sure that WordPress is widely distributable; the polyglots team work on translations, accessibility does some work, docs make sure that everything is documented, and training, of course, gets things ready for when we have to be able to tell people how to use the release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there is the fourth phase; I really don&#8217;t think they go sequentially or in a waterfall format. The fourth-ish phase that I include, and that I tend to see, is this extending and iteration phase. It&#8217;s the phase where we see our theme authors and our plugin authors, folks who are doing support, show up and help us to make sure that WordPress is available not only widely but broadly to ensure that their audiences as theme authors and plugin authors are covered in the features that they need based on what they are using WordPress for. The fifth phase is the part of our communication that involves the community team, especially marketing, WordPressTV, and learn.wordpress.org. Basically, anyone who&#8217;s showing up to make sure that we all share what happened in the release, the features that are coming, and how that affects the users is involved in that particular phase. So five big phases of what happens over those four to five months, and then for the month or month and a half afterward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we zoom in a bit more on the creation phase, each release has people who lead the work and coordinate contributor efforts during the course of the release. For any given release, hundreds of people contribute and receive credit for moving the WordPress project forward. Okay, hold on a second. Let&#8217;s pump the brakes and zoom in a bit on that. Hundreds of people work on every major release for a project that powers over 40% of the web that feels like a small number. But for the people who process the contributions in preparation for release, it&#8217;s actually pretty substantial. For every release, there is a small team of leaders who asked the hard questions. Is this a usable feature? Does this make WordPress better overall? And, of course, is this ready to ship?&nbsp; Some of those leaders, a smaller subset of even the leaders that we have already, are committers who actually prep and merge patches to the CMS; they don&#8217;t do all the work to create a design or write all the code. This tiny group of people processes hundreds and hundreds of bug fixes, improvements, and enhancements that have been submitted over the course of months and sometimes years. As a side note, that whole process is a little smaller, a little faster in the Gutenberg featured plugin, but the basic parts are still there. Alright, so we&#8217;ve zoomed from the big picture way into some of the finer details, and it really looks like any other project cycle. So now, I&#8217;m going to layer in the filter of open source to that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of things that make building software in an open source environment so different. The first is that the code is readily available. If you have a basic understanding of the languages, you can see the code, learn from it, and make suggestions about improving it. Second, you consider the user a co-developer in the process, which means that as long as people use your product, they will have opinions on what you shipped. This way of iterating improves WordPress and ties back to one of my favorite open source principles. The idea that with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. To me, that means that with enough people looking at a problem, someone is bound to be able to see the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our community highlight, the segment where I share a note about contributors who have helped others along the way or a WordPress success story. This week&#8217;s highlight is from Nok in our Bangkok community. When asked to help her find her way into the WordPress community, she said, “@shinichiN who started the WordPress community in Bangkok and encouraged me to contribute, and also @mayukojpn has introduced me to the WP community team to join as a deputy. “ Thank you for sharing those two inspiring people with us. And if you, listener, have any stories that you would like to share of your own WordPress success or people that you have been so grateful to help you find your way in the project, you can feel free to email those to me at <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@wordpress.org\">wpbriefing@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our final segment of the WP Briefing, the small list of big things. I only have three things to share with you this week. The first one is that about a week ago, we had our first release of 2021. It was the WordPress 5.7 release, titled Esperanza. If you have not yet seen it, go ahead and update your website or check with your host and make sure that they have updated you if you&#8217;re on a managed host. And then take a listen to the artists that it&#8217;s named after.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I want you to keep an eye out for is wordpress.org/news. We are starting a new series of content that gets at the heart of some of Gutenberg’s basic parts; there’s a lot of change coming up in the next few releases of WordPress. And the most important thing to me is that you understand what we&#8217;re trying to change and where those changes are primarily taking place. There will be a couple of tutorials that go up there over the course of the of the next few weeks. The third item on the small list of big things is to remind you of our call for testing. As I mentioned earlier in the podcast, the users of any open source software are the code developers; the software built is supposed to make your life and work easier. When you test things and find interactions that can use a little bit of refinement or features that are not working exactly as expected, it&#8217;s incredibly helpful for us to have that information to always make sure that we&#8217;re solving problems instead of accidentally creating them. If you want to participate in the Current call for testing, you can head over to make.wordpress.org/test. Or, if you&#8217;ve been doing your own testing, you can also submit any bugs you have found in the GitHub repo, which I will share in the show notes below. So that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"9980\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"WordPress 5.7 “Esperanza”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/esperanza/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Mar 2021 20:52:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9888\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:355:\"Meet “Esperanza”, the first WordPress release of 2021. “Esperanza” is named in honor of Esperanza Spalding, a modern musical prodigy.

The editor helps you work in a few places you couldn’t before without getting into code or hiring a pro. The controls you use most are right where you need them. Layout changes that should be simple, are even simpler to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now the new editor is easier to use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Font-size adjustment in more places:</strong>&nbsp;now, font-size controls are right where you need them in the List and Code blocks. No more trekking to another screen to make that single change!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reusable blocks:</strong>&nbsp;several enhancements make reusable blocks more stable and easier to use. And now they save automatically with the post when you click the Update button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inserter drag-and-drop:</strong>&nbsp;drag blocks and block patterns from the inserter right into your post.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.7/about-57-drag-drop-image.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>You can do more without writing custom code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full-height alignment:</strong>&nbsp;have you ever wanted to make a block, like the Cover block, fill the whole window? Now you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buttons block:</strong>&nbsp;now you can choose a vertical or a horizontal layout. And you can set the width of a button to a preset percentage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Icons block:</strong>&nbsp;now you can change the size of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/5.7/about-57-cover.jpg?w=632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>A simpler default color palette</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This new streamlined color palette collapses all the colors that used to be in the WordPress source code down to seven core colors and a range of 56 shades that meet the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance\">WCAG 2.0 AA recommended contrast ratio</a> against white or black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find the new palette in the default WordPress Dashboard color scheme, and use it when you’re building themes, plugins, or any other components. For all the details,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/02/23/standardization-of-wp-admin-colors-in-wordpress-5-7\">check out the Color Palette dev note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From HTTP to HTTPS in a single click</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting now, switching a site from HTTP to HTTPS is a one-click move. WordPress will automatically update database URLs when you make the switch. No more hunting and guessing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Robots API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Robots API lets you include the filter directives in the robots meta tag, and the API includes the&nbsp;<code>max-image-preview: large</code>&nbsp;directive by default. That means search engines can show bigger image previews, which can boost your traffic (unless the site is marked&nbsp;<em>not-public</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lazy-load your iFrames</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it’s simple to let iframes lazy-load. By default, WordPress will add a&nbsp;<code>loading=\"lazy\"</code>&nbsp;attribute to iframe tags when both width and height are specified.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ongoing cleanup after update to jQuery 3.5.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For years jQuery helped make things move on the screen in ways the basic tools couldn’t—but that keeps changing, and so does jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.7, jQuery gets more focused and less intrusive, with fewer messages in the console.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check the Field Guide for more!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the latest version of the WordPress Field Guide.

is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories that are lesser-known.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From a natural interest in computers and fixing things as a young woman, Olga Gleckler from St Petersburg, Russia, found WordPress took her on a journey to becoming a successful female tech entrepreneur. On International Women’s Day, we share her story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=580%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga with a WordCamp Vienna t-shirt\" class=\"wp-image-9878\" width=\"580\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=773%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 773w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=768%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=1159%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1159w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=1546%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1546w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?w=1932&amp;ssl=1 1932w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Finding your path can take longer than you expect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the age of 15, Olga found herself under pressure to find a free place for her professional studies. She said: “I didn’t know how high or low my chances were even if I had very good marks. I could have been just the biggest fish in a small pond. But anyway, I made up my mind to go to technical school.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On leaving school in St Petersburg with her certificate, Olga felt her knowledge of opportunities was very narrow. She had pictured being an ecologist or guide translator based on the subjects she had been taught at school. There was also an advertising boom in Russia and she began to explore this as a career avenue. She had developed her computer skills and found opportunities to practise by helping her teachers with administrative work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though she did not have access to any formal career advice, her journey led her into programming. She said: “The range of technical schools was not wide. I spent four years studying transistor markings, soldering and drawing PCB layouts. Programming courses using Pascal didn&#8217;t do anything useful with it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lack of suitable access to English-language courses made things harder for Olga. She was determined that she would master the language later in her life. In the meantime, she left technical school with an honors degree and improved typing skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I faced it was a wild, unfriendly market. I didn’t know how to recognize a genuine job offer or how to avoid the bad ones. It was difficult and I don’t know how long I would’ve looked for work without help.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Think differently to find where you belong</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga&#8217;s father worked in an IT company and was able to give her some advice and help with potential introductions. When she was still studying, he suggested her strong technical skills might be useful as a substitute typist. When she finished her studies, he helped her apply for a job updating a legal system on clients’ computers.<br><br>Six months later, she got a full-time job in the same service department. She liked her position and her clients. However, she was given friendly advice that without a university degree she would not be able to have any further promotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time, Olga was trying to study PHP from a book. She found it very exciting at first, but a lot of their functions did not give her explanations on how to build something useful. She found when she tried to build practical items from book reading, it did not always make sense and the solutions would often fail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “It was hard to admit a failure even to myself and it was nagging me for a long time. I had to choose something I could handle, that I was interested in and could afford. It turned out to be advertising.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She spent most of the family’s holidays on learning sessions during the next six years. Olga recalled: “It was tricky for my husband to make me leave a computer, once I was glued to it, so he bought me my first laptop. English was still hard for me, I got high marks through just memorizing all the words in a textbook and how they should sound.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Doubting your professional skills can happen when you are at home isolated looking after children. Keeping up your interests is important.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga’s life took a change after having a new baby and she spent three years doubting her professional skills and her chances of getting a good job. She tried to get back into other interests through studying, baking and drawing, but found ‘the pram was pulling me back’. She found she became very isolated and felt less able to contribute as the family was relying on her husband’s income as she tried to focus on looking forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I was convinced (and saw) that not too many companies wanted a woman in the office, who with a small baby might need lots of leave.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She finished her education when she returned to work after three years caring for her son. She secured a promotion but with changes in the company’s staffing, things were tense. She found the difficulties there had become more heightened and felt that young female colleagues were treated as ‘pieces of furniture’ by one manager. She did not want to stay in this environment and in a few months time decided to leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Your next chapter may be nearby</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Determined to not repeat this type of experience, Olga looked at the brighter side. She said: “I wanted to be a marketer. Knowing how tricky it is to sell intangibles, I wanted a solid product to work with.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turned out to be more difficult to find a job outside traditional IT as a young mother. Some human resource officers advised her to remain within the technology arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga remained hopeful and continued to study hard. She had many learning experiences along the way, which she hopes others can learn from too. One was setting a low bar to employers. She said: “Companies I worked in wanted to get all publicity and sales increases achieved through deductions from my salary.” This happened once and the next time she was in this situation she asked specifically about the budget before signing up. &#8220;I was assured this would not be the case, but again I found the budget for publicity came out of my wages. It was a tough period of disappointments. So when I was offered a part-time administrative job with basic sick leave, I took it gladly as a reprieve.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The job was far from home and involved a lot of travelling. Olga spent two to three hours a day on buses with Harry Potter audio books for company. “In these traffic jams, I started to feel English at last and loved it. It gave me a freedom no money can buy. Life was getting better.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the job did not pay highly, it gave her something valuable &#8211; a working website. After her boss and the developer parted company, she was asked to maintain the site. Through some studying and reverse engineering, she discovered how it worked and it gave her an insight into how to write simple websites from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga’s first encounter with JavaScript wasn’t easy: “My first JavaScript calculator almost made me crazy, but I pursued it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quickly she started to get small tasks from friends and relatives, usually to solve some urgent problems and started to meet popular content management systems. One of the first she met with was WordPress. There was an issue in a website theme used by a website which had been changed and not maintained. It took a whole weekend to solve, but she was determined to work it out. Back then, WordPress was ‘just a system’. She didn’t know then how much it was to become part of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga spent the next two years in this role. As time went on, she started to feel worried and less satisfied with the work. The last straw for her was a negative statement from her boss, who was not a programmer and who hadn’t seen any of the work done on the website. She felt the approach was unfair as she had done extensive work on the site. She recalls: “I became angry, but it was exactly what I needed to move jobs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Olga was job hunting, she didn&#8217;t feel she had the courage to apply for a developer’s role, despite the learning and work she had already done. So instead she started working on projects where she felt she was more like a ‘seller of box-ready websites’. It was another tough half a year for her with a lot of work, low payment and plans not turning out as she had hoped. On top of long hours, she ended up with pneumonia. She said: “I see now that I was doing a disservice to customers, websites are not a microwave meal &#8211; quick, cheap and dummy. There was no life in the sites without a lot of work which no one was willing to buy. Most of the sites I sold back then died after the first year and they never were truly alive and useful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>You need to be brave and have courage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=632%2C422&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga in Berlin wearing the WordPress Code is Poetry lanyard and a WordCamp t-shirt\" class=\"wp-image-9879\" width=\"632\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga really wanted a developer job but seeking jobs of this type was very frustrating. From the job adverts she found, it felt like most IT companies were asking for geniuses who already knew a lot of technologies and frameworks. She found this very demotivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She then found a job offer on a website outside the most popular job portals  and it seemed like a perfect fit. They wanted someone with experience to write from scratch, understand someone else’s code and maintain it, with an ability to translate technical documentation and articles, and make simple designs for printing products. After completing a trial task, she was taken on, and enjoyed a better salary, in a calm environment with good colleagues and without the requirement for a lot of extra hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advert turned out to be a direct ad from one of the sales departments in a technology company. By succeeding in the  task set, Olga had bypassed the Human Resources team which she felt&nbsp;would not normally have considered her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her boss agreed to her working remotely most of the time. It solved any potential leave problems which Olga had thought may be an obstacle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Olga it had been 14 years since the original decision to become a programmer and it was only the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few years at what she describes as an ‘amazing experience’ in this workplace, Olga felt able to move on to her next challenge as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Decision-making can benefit from wider knowledge</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After working with different systems Olga became sure that WordPress is the best CMS for developers and clients. But she was disappointed to find that the ease of use meant that good code was not always a priority for some of the sites she looked at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The biggest flaw of WordPress &#8211; it’s so easy to make things work that some may feel they don’t need to bother to do things right, but this becomes a problem later.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In custom themes for a site, she also saw sites being made and clients left without any further support, or items hard coded when clients actually needed more control to change regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga used to rely on examples she could easily find, documentation and search engines to improve her understanding in using WordPress. She discovered that just by searching for a specific feature or a solution, you can miss the whole picture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She turned to online courses to get more comprehensive knowledge and then started to attend WordPress events, firstly online and then by foot, trains and planes! She discovered a worldwide community that was very much alive. She didn’t know when she started studying online materials and attending discussions that she would end up contributing herself to the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> platform a few years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamps and contributor days became a big part of her life. From her early days attending events and starting out contributing to WordPress, she is an active member of the WordPress.org Global Marketing and Polyglots Teams, and supported the recent WordPress release. She is just beginning her first WordCamp organiser experience, joining WordCamp Europe 2021 on the Contribute Team. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=632%2C602&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga next to a banner of WordCamp St Petersburg 2018\" class=\"wp-image-9883\" width=\"632\" height=\"602\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=1024%2C976&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=300%2C286&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=768%2C732&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=1536%2C1464&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=2048%2C1951&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga said: “Through the wider WordPress community, I knew not only where to look but also whom to ask.

It is the path that got her where she is today, and she continues to find joy in it. She retains the lessons she’s learned and is always hungry to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“I travelled through a very uneven path, with a lot of obstacles and noise, but for me it’s like a kaleidoscope where a little turn presents a new picture, a new “ah-ha” moment, new excitement after seemingly pointless efforts.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “When in doubt I remind myself about David Ogilvy (generally considered the Founding Father of the modern advertising industry) who tried a lot of things before he struck gold with advertising, and maybe that’s why he did.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, she learned not only to keep a good spirit and try different things, but also to dare as you move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>).

The site editor and global styles are not landing in the next release. However, several other features should launch and allow users to build their sites with blocks in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following people attended the demo:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mat&iacute;as Ventura &ndash; Demo Host and Gutenberg Project Lead</li><li>Matt Mullenweg &ndash; WordPress Project Lead</li><li>Helen Hou-Sand&iacute; &ndash; Lead Developer</li><li>Josepha Haden Chomphosy &ndash; Executive Director</li><li>H&eacute;ctor Prieto &ndash; Technical Project Manager</li><li>Chlo&eacute; Bringmann &ndash; Assisting with administrative and operational logistics</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura walked the group through the various FSE features that could be ready for WordPress 5.8, taking questions and discussing along the way. There was also a discussion afterward that focused on ideas beyond the next release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following FSE-related features are expected to ship:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Improvements from Gutenberg 9.9+.</li><li>New theme-related blocks like Query, Site Logo, Navigation, and more.</li><li><code>theme.json</code> integration, which allows themes to define block defaults and settings.</li><li>Template-editing mode for the block editor.</li><li>Block-based widgets screen and customizer integration.</li><li>New block design tools, such as duotone (SVG filters for images), layout controls, padding, and more.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Not all of the above are currently ready but there&rsquo;s some level of confidence that they can be by the time of 5.8,&rdquo; noted Haden Chomphosy in the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list feels like a solid compromise between launching some of the more polished FSE features and trying to force in those that are probably out of reach for a July 2021 release. The features also provide current users access to new block tools without activating a block-based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group focused on the Query block for much of the early discussion. The Gutenberg development team will likely change the block&rsquo;s user-facing name to something less confusing. It also needs a bit more polishing to make things more user-friendly.  I am interested in seeing how theme authors use this in conjunction with patterns once this launches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other feature that users should look forward to is the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-initial-designs-for-wordpress-block-pattern-directory\">pattern directory</a>. While it is not ready for integration into the WordPress admin UI, it does not need to be. Users will be able to copy patterns from the directory and paste them directly into their editor. In time, it should become a part of the built-in experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group seems to have made a good call on which features to include. It is easy to want to push forward and get everything into the hands of users. It can be tougher to pull back and compromise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full video of the demo:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I had two takeaways that stood out to me more than anything in the meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Takeaway #1: Page Template Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In WordPress 5.8, users should gain access to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-round-of-the-fse-outreach-program-concludes-identifies-template-editing-mode-problems\">template editor</a>. On the page-editing screen, it allows users to switch out of content-editing mode. From there, they can work on the overall template. Essentially, for this release, it would serve as a landing page builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a sort of middle ground between just the block editor and the eventual site editor. I like this route because it does not overwhelm end-users with a complete site-editing experience at once. It is a helping hand, a transition from the current phase to the next, allowing users to familiarize themselves with more advanced tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The template editor will work for all users too. They will not be required to run a block-based theme to access it. Because each template would be a one-off use case, WordPress can serve this up without theme authors opting into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many block-ready themes have already been including an &ldquo;open canvas&rdquo; type of template. This would remove the need for those unless also including it for third-party builders. It would also solve the portability issue when users switch from a theme that bundles the template and one that does not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Takeaway #2: Many Block-Based Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">At the end of the discussion, the group was more or less spitballing some ideas beyond version 5.8. In particular, Hou-Sand&iacute; shared a vision of what theme development for the official directory could look like in the era of FSE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Because the full site editing, like from a user-facing point of view, is not about page building all the time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about tweaking what&rsquo;s there. Yeah. So I feel like the correct thing for core to do in terms of bundled themes is actually a bunch of small bundled themes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have previously written about how work on <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/work-on-the-twenty-twenty-two-default-wordpress-theme-should-already-be-underway\">Twenty Twenty-Two should already be underway</a> instead of waiting until the last moment to piece a new default theme together for the end-of-the-year launch. The yearly default theme system has served the community well for over a decade now. I am already warming to the idea of turning it on its head and forging a new path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With FSE, developers do not necessarily have to follow all of the rules of traditional themes. Themes like Kjell Reigstad&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/carrd-like-theme-experiment-provides-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-theming\">Carrd-like, two-column landing page theme</a> would be well-suited to such an experiment. Smaller, more experimental projects like this could replace the old Twenty* theme system with something new or even complement it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hou-Sand&iacute; also threw out a few ideas around building block-based themes via a library of CC0 images, the patterns directory, and copying/pasting things from WordPress.org.

Payouts are typically $100K but have been temporarily increased to $300K. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company focuses on acquiring original and previously unreported zero-day research. It pays researchers for high-risk vulnerabilities and fully functional exploits, with the highest rewards at $2.5M for &lsquo;full chain, zero-click, with persistence&rsquo; Android exploits. This price tag was increased from $200K in September 2019, suggesting Android exploits have become more difficult to find or that demand for them has increased significantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We\'re temporarily increasing our payouts for WordPress RCEs to $300,000 per exploit (usually $100K). <br /><br />The exploit must work with latest WordPress, default install, no third-party plugins, no auth, no user interaction!<br /><br />If you have this gem, contact us: <a href=\"https://t.co/PBuS1nnpED\">https://t.co/PBuS1nnpED</a></p>&mdash; Zerodium (@Zerodium) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zerodium/status/1380489573009031170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Exploit resellers operate within a sort of grey area of security research. As a standard practice, security researchers are encouraged to report vulnerabilities to the original developer of the software, not an intermediary that may pass it along to a party that may not use the information for good. The appeal of these companies is that they pay more than most organizations, hence the tagline: &ldquo;<em>We pay BIG bounties, not bug bounties.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has an account with <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress/\">Hackerone</a> to pay security researchers for vulnerabilities but <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress/hacktivity?type=team\">payouts</a> are much smaller in comparison to what exploit brokers pay. This makes it a tough choice for security researchers who do this for a living. Professional zero-day hunters are looking for the highest payouts for the vulnerabilities they find, which can sometimes take months or longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Zerodium does not reveal who its clients are or what their purpose is for buying the the vulnerabilities. The best case scenario would be a government entity wanting to secure its own systems. Even then one cannot guarantee that they use the exploit ethically or that they don&rsquo;t inadvertently leak the exploits where they could be used maliciously by others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zerodium did not elaborate on why it has increased payouts for WordPress exploits to $300K. <a href=\"https://blog.wpscan.com/2021/04/10/zerodium-wordpress-exploit.html\">WPScan</a> speculates that the company may suddenly have a greater demand for WordPress RCE exploits, combined with WordPress becoming more secure:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This could indicate that WordPress is becoming more secure and that it is getting harder to find the critical security issues that buyers want. On the other hand, we must also assume that these types of exploits already exist and are already being actively sold on Zerodium and other similar platforms.</p><p>We could also conclude that if a government is going to pay more than $300,000 on a WordPress RCE exploit, that they intend to use it. World governments may even barter over the exploits so that the seller, in this case, Zerodium, gets the best price.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WPScan also emphasized that with WordPress having such a large presence on the web, an exploit against core with those particular characteristics &ldquo;would be devastating to the web as a whole if it landed in the wrong hands.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Zerodium increasing their prices may indicate that it is becoming harder to find these critical issues in WordPress Core,&rdquo; WPScan founder and CEO Ryan Dewhurst said. &ldquo;That, at least, should be good news for WordPress and the web as a whole.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:11:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.7.1 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10144\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/04/wordpress-5-7-1-security-and-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8387:\"<p>WordPress 5.7.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This security and maintenance release features <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=5.7.1&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&order=priority\">26 bug fixes</a> in addition to two security fixes.

Since December, it has called for and completed four rounds of testing. The latest round asks volunteers to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/04/14/fse-program-testing-call-5-query-quest/\">provide feedback on the Query block</a>, arguably one of the most crucial pieces of the FSE-puzzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic Developer Relations Wrangler Anne McCarthy has been overseeing the program since its inception. Each round of testing asks participants to follow along with a set of instructions while testing a specific feature related to FSE. They can then provide feedback on what does or does not work. Thus far, the program has tested and identified issues for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-round-of-the-fse-outreach-program-concludes-identifies-template-editing-mode-problems\">template-editing mode</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-2-building-a-custom-homepage-with-gutenbergs-site-editor\">building a custom homepage</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-full-site-editing-testing-challenge-create-a-custom-404-page\">creating a 404 page</a>, and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header-with-gutenbergs-site-editor\">wrangling a restaurant-themed header</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers for the program should install the latest version of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg\">Gutenberg plugin</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks theme</a>. Participation is open to all, and further details are available through the announcement post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest test is all about the Query block &mdash; McCarthy is dubbing it a &ldquo;Query Quest.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Not many blocks get an entire milestone dedicated to them but the Query Block did!&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;As the name implies, this is a pretty powerful block allowing you to display posts/pages on your site and customize them as you see fit. For example, you could easily use this block to show off all of your favorite recipes by setting it up to show a specific category of posts.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, theme authors will primarily work with this block. However, for those end-users who will inevitably want to customize post output on their sites, they may need to at least have some basic familiarity with it or its block variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building With the Query Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Following the instructions for the testing round netted fairly consistent results between the editor and front end. Each step walks participants through the process of assembling a two-column page with posts from separate categories. Within just a few minutes, I built a few demo posts with custom categories named &ldquo;Veggie Garden&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fruit Trees&rdquo; (side note: these are pics of my plants). I sped through the process with no issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Using Columns to output two category-based Query blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am a bit of a pro at this point with the Query block. It is one feature I have been eyeing at least every week for months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two primary issues I ran into were with the &ldquo;read more&rdquo; link and spacing. For the more-link, it simply did not appear on the front end. When viewing the source code, the wrapper HTML was there, but the actual text was nowhere to be found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for spacing, this is more of a theme problem. I have harped on this issue in past testing rounds, and it is the same ol&rsquo; tune. TT1 Blocks failed to produce consistent spacing between the front and back end. One example is when using the Post Featured Image block followed by the Post Excerpt block. In the editor, there is little whitespace between the two. On the front end, there is ample room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some might say it is the most vital part of page building &mdash; nailing down the layout. I have voiced my concerns <em>ad nauseam</em> on spacing, so I have nothing new to report on the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to take a few extra steps and move beyond the basic testing instructions. Because it is springtime, I have been enjoying the outdoors a bit more as of late. I wanted to spruce up my Query block design. I wrapped the initial design in a Cover block with a garden-related background image, dropped in some header and intro text, and created boxes for my posts with the Group block. With a splash of color, some font-size changes, and a Spacer block here and there, I built something with a tiny bit more personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom layout with the Query, Cover, and Columns blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>Testing never has to be boring.

I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, connect with Topher of HeroPress, and tell my story!</p>\n<h3>How I Landed Into a WordPress Job</h3>\n<p>My WordPress journey began by chance! Honestly, I didn’t know WordPress until I landed on a WordPress job.</p>\n<p>Back then, I was doing my Master’s degree in Sociology and had just left my work as a school teacher. I was looking for a job that would allow me to focus on my study and pay me a decent salary.</p>\n<p>I had a long career of over 5 years in teaching which was a full-time job. In addition to 9 AM to 5 PM work, we had to work extra hours at home &#8211; designing lesson plans, evaluating assignment works, exams, etc. – so I was finding it hard to manage time for my own study. I just needed a job that wouldn’t require me to work after office hours.</p>\n<p>After applying to several different positions, I finally got a content writing job. Fortunately, the company turned out to be a successful WordPress development company based in Nepal (<a href=\"https://access-keys.com/\">Access Keys</a>).</p>\n<p>Well, it’s how my WordPress story began! But it’s not the full story.</p>\n<h3>For Hope! My Family’s Struggle for Education</h3>\n<p>I come from a remote village in the hills of Nepal, not connected by any means of transportation until recently. We had to walk a minimum of an hour to go to the nearest school, from where I completed my secondary education.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But that time wasn’t just about walking hours to reach school. It was also about poverty, hardships, and the burning desire to overcome them someday!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schools were first opened in the late 1970s in our village but my parents couldn’t even complete the lower secondary level. Pervasive poverty and lack of awareness both were responsible for it.</p>\n<p>Time passed but our family’s financial condition was still the same. But my parents had understood that the only way out of it was education. Hence, they decided to send us to school, no matter what. Our father sometimes as a seasonal migrant worker to India, sometimes as a porter, brought us (me and my siblings) school supplies. Our mother worked day and night, managed home, family, and our farm.</p>\n<p>After completing secondary level education, I moved to a nearby city in the guardianship of my aunt. With minimal financial support from my parents, my aunt helped me complete higher secondary school.</p>\n<p>However, she had her own hardships. She was a single mother without any academic degree so had to work minimum-wage jobs which hardly met her and her family’s needs.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I couldn’t simply add to her burden. And on the other side, my parents had to support my younger siblings too. So, the only choice I had, if I wanted to study further, was to support myself, for which I started teaching in a school.</p>\n<h3>Breakthrough through English Language Skills</h3>\n<p>I got my life’s first job but it wasn’t easy. I joined a private English-medium school as a teacher. But my schooling as well as the undergraduate program had been in our national language, Nepali, and not in English. We had “English” as a subject in school but the teacher taught us English in the Nepali language. We never spoke in English. Yet, my English writing was fine as I was a good student.</p>\n<p>When I joined an English medium school as a teacher, I had no choice but to improve my English. I practiced speaking English with primary-level students. Within a year, my spoken English improved considerably.</p>\n<p>Along with my teaching job, I continued my college. It was a super-busy schedule but was the only option I had! With my earnings, I paid my college fees, covered some of my living expenses, and also supported my family. Well, this is how I completed my Bachelor’s degree and started my Master’s degree too.</p>\n<p>Later on, the same teaching job that I started to sustain myself enabled me to apply for an English content writing job! As of now, I’m quite confident about my English language skills but still feel hesitant when I have to talk with native speakers.</p>\n<h3>My WordPress Journey – Toward Freedom</h3>\n<p>As I stated earlier, I landed on my first WordPress job when I was looking for the type of job that would allow me free time for my study. Yes, and that’s from where my journey toward freedom began!</p>\n<p>During my interview, I explained to the CEO of <a href=\"https://access-keys.com/\">Access Keys</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/athakuri\">Arjun Singh Thakuri</a>) about the flexibility that I need in my new job so that I could also focus well on my studies. I was hired and could join from 11 AM instead of the usual 9:30 AM after attending my classes in the morning. It was a moment of gratitude and great relief for me!</p>\n<p>I learnt WordPress at Access Keys. <em><strong>First</strong></em>, by reading Wikipedia and other blogs on the web. <em><strong>Second</strong></em>, from Arjun sir as well as from the senior developers and the designers at the company. I used to have a lot of questions, and my team at Access Keys helped me get answers to those questions. <em><strong>Third</strong></em>, by doing. I set up a WordPress.com blog, a testing site on localhost, and tried different options.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My curiosity was definitely the driving force, but above all, ‘the way WordPress is built’ is what made it possible for someone like me (with no technical background) to understand a powerful website creation software, WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As for content writing skills, I started with list articles (theme collections). Arjun sir mentored me for my first few articles. Later, Access Keys hired an experienced SEO professional <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seonerdy\">Amin Ghale</a> who taught me more about SEO and content writing. He is a mentor cum brother to me.</p>\n<p>When in Access Keys, I joined WordCamp for the first time – <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>. The event was grand! I met people involved in WordPress from other companies in Nepal and abroad, heard their stories, and learnt about new innovations in WordPress!</p>\n<p>I was truly enthralled by the event and had truly wished to give a presentation in a WordCamp someday. And I did, the very next year! I shared what I had learnt so far on the title ‘SEO Copywriting for WordPress’ at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi64ajv-_TvAhVCCM0KHdXKAVoQFjAAegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkathmandu.wordcamp.org%2F2016%2F&usg=AOvVaw0nTcwn8d7MOgIp2sDtNhOD\">WordCamp Kathmandu 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>Later, I also joined a panel ‘Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career’ in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiCzcj_-_TvAhUJbc0KHfLUAWMQFjAAegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbiratnagar.wordcamp.org%2F2018%2F&usg=AOvVaw1on2S3L2VlRRUTeN9eYsqa\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a> along with a dear friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandilyakafle\">Ganga Kafle</a> and my WordPress sister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prithuthakuri\">Prithu Singh Thakuri</a>. Now, looking forward to joining some international WordCamps!</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wordcampkathmandu2016speaker-srai/\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1349\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wordcampkathmandu2016speaker-srai.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Speaking at WordCamp Kathmandu 2016 S Rai\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/a-journey-toward-freedom-with-wordpress/wordcampbiratnagar2018panel/\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/wordcampbiratnagar2018panel.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Sunita Rai on a panel at WordCamp\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/a-journey-toward-freedom-with-wordpress/wordcampkathmandu2017fun/\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1367\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/wordcampkathmandu2017fun.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wordcampkathmandu2018-fun/\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wordcampkathmandu2018-fun.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"A Moment of Fun at WordCamp Kathmandu 2018\" /></a>\n\n<p>About my WordPress career, I’m still in WordPress content writing.</p>\n<p>After Access Keys, I went to ThemeGrill, another successful WordPress business in Nepal, with even more flexibility and freedom in the working hours.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sanjipshah\">Sanjip Shah</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rabinsthaa\">Rabin Shrestha</a> (Founders of ThemeGrill) encouraged me to learn and explore this field even more. After some time, ThemeGrill hired a few new writers and I started mentoring them.</p>\n<p>Next, I joined Awesome Motive, the company behind the popular WPBeginner blog. In the beginning, I wrote for IsItWP and MonsterInsights blog but later also got the opportunity to write for WPBeginner. When at Awesome Motive, I got an even better opportunity to learn WordPress and marketing skills.</p>\n<p>My supervisors <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shahzadsaeed\">Shahzad Saeed</a> from India, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/noumaan_\">Noumaan Yaqoob</a> from Pakistan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LittleZotzWrite\">Lauren Tharp</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keri_engel\">Keri Lynn Engel</a> from the United States helped me be better at my work. Above all, I was super lucky to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syedbalkhi\">Syed Balkhi</a> himself tutoring me every week on various aspects of content writing and marketing. I still remember how he explained the “success gap” over multiple calls, over weeks. He’s really a wonderful mentor!</p>\n<p>As of now, I work with beginners who’re just starting their careers in WordPress content writing. I’m trying to help small WordPress businesses and blogs with the marketing skills I’ve acquired so far. For example, SiteSaga.com, ZakraTheme.com are some of the sites I’m currently working on. Yet, I feel there’s a lot more for me to learn!</p>\n<p>Now, I want to make my final and important point – freedom!</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, my WordPress job allowed me the freedom to work on my time (so I could manage time for my study too). But more importantly, I meant the ‘economic freedom’.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For an individual, economic independence is a major freedom factor! Income isn’t everything, but definitely a basic aspect of human development!</p>\n<p>My salary at my first WordPress job wasn’t high, but increments since then are cool! Plus, we can always do some extra work. For instance, after my talk at WordCamp, I got a lot of freelance work opportunities, which I did during my free time and earned some extra bucks. Then, I was able to support my family even better.</p>\n<p>Finally, it&#8217;s the &#8216;feeling of freedom&#8217; that, I have now, enabled me to share this story. I always had an &#8216;inferiority complex&#8217; due to which I could never tell anyone about my family or our socio-economic background. Even if someone asked, I&#8217;d simply avoid the question or lie to them.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve now overcome the situation as well as the fear of being judged. And, I believe it&#8217;s the &#8216;freedom&#8217; in its truest sense.</p>\n<p>That’s my story of freedom! Story of our freedom!</p>\n<h3>Now is Great! I Have Greater Aspiration for the Future!</h3>\n<p>Yes, now is great! I have a good career as a WordPress content writer, editor, and mentor. I also joined the MPhil degree and will soon complete it.</p>\n<p>For the future, have greater aspirations!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I hope to continue doing what I do &#8211; teaching beginners copywriting skills and help them achieve their part of freedom. WordPress is a gift for people like me!</li>\n<li>I want to earn a Doctorate degree; not yet content being a student! I haven’t planned it yet but I really wish to do it in this life!</li>\n<li>I want to give back to my community. Our village hasn’t changed much &#8211; still struggling with poverty. Even today, most students from my village fail to complete their university degree in lack of a support system. I firmly believe education is vital to change; for individuals as well as society as a whole. So, I really wish to work on it but I’m not yet sure how! I hope time will answer!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks for reading my story! Thanks, dear friend Topher for this opportunity! It’s a privilege to be sharing my story on HeroPress (feeling like a hero!). :D</p>\n<p>Thank you to every single individual who supported my journey to this date! And, thanks to the universe for everything I have!</p>\n<hr class=\"ttfmake-hr\" />\n<h1 id=\"nepali\">वर्डप्रेससंगै स्वतन्त्रता तर्फको यात्रामा</h1>\n<p>नमस्कार संसार!</p>\n<p>तपाईंसँग जे छ त्यसैमा

तयारी र गृहकार्य जाँच गर्दा गर्दै ठिक्क हुन्थ्यो। जसले गर्दा मलाई आफ्नो पढाई सम्हाल्न गाह्रो भइरहेको थियो। त्यसैले मलाई खासगरि अफिस समयपश्चात अरु थप काम गर्नु नपर्ने खालको काम चाहिएको थियो।</p>\n<p>धेरै खालको जागिरहरूमा आवेदन दिएपश्चात बल्ल कन्टेन्ट राइटिङ्ग (इन्टरनेटको लागि लेख लेखन) को जागिर पाए। भाग्यवश मैले काम पाएको कम्पनी वर्डप्रेस विकासको क्षेत्रमा नेपालको एक सफल कम्पनी रहेछ (<a href=\"https://access-keys.com/\">एक्सेस किइज</a>)।</p>\n<p>हो यसरी नै मेरो वर्डप्रेसको यात्रा सुरु भयो, तर यो नै सम्पुर्ण कथा भने हैन।</p>\n<h3>शिक्षाको लागि मेरो परिवारको संघर्ष र आशा</h3>\n<p>नेपाल को पहाडी भेगमा अवस्थित एउटा गाउँमा मेरो जन्म भएको हो जहाँ आवतजावत गर्नलाई अझैसम्मपनि भरपर्दो सडक अनि गाडीहरूको ब्यबस्था भएको छैन। हाम्रो घरबाट नजिकैको विद्यालय नै १ घण्टा को बाटो हिडेर पुग्नुपर्थ्यो र त्यहि विद्यालय बाट मैले कक्षा १० सम्म को अध्ययन पुरा गरें।</p>\n<blockquote><p>तर हाम्रो गाउँको त्यो समय घन्टौ हिड्नुपर्ने दुखका बारेमा मात्र थिएन। सर्वत्र ब्याप्त गरिवी, खानलाउनको लागि कठिन संघर्ष, र यि तमाम दुखबाट कुनै दिन मुक्त हुने प्रबल आकङ्क्षाको पनि समय थियो।</p></blockquote>\n<p>हाम्रो गाउँमा विद्यालय सन १९७० को दशक अन्त्य तिर खुले तर मेरो आमाबाबुले भने गरिवी र अशिक्षाको कारण निम्न माध्यमिक तहको शिक्षा सम्म पनि पुरा गर्न सक्नुभएन। समय बित्यो, हामि बिद्यालय जान थाल्यौ तर पनि हाम्रो परिवारको आर्थिक अवस्थामा भने कुनै सुधार आएको थिएन। तरपनि मेरा बुबाआमाले भने शिक्षाको महत्व बुझिसक्नु भएको थियो। त्यसैले उहाहरुले जस्तो सुकै अप्ठ्यारो परिस्थिति भए पनि हामी लाई विद्यालय पठाउने निधो गर्नुभयो।</p>\n<p>आपा (राई बान्तावा भाषामा बुबा) कहिले भारततिर मौसमी कामदार को रूपमा त कहिले भरियाको रूपमा काम गर्न जानुहुन्थ्यो। अनि फर्केर आउँदा म र मेरो बहिनीहरू लाई किताब कापी र स्कुलको कपडा हरू ल्याइदिनु हुन्थ्यो। हाम्रो आमा भने रातदिन आफैं खटेर घरपरिवार, खेतिपाती र गाइबस्तु सम्हाल्नु हुन्थो।</p>\n<p>गाउँकै बिध्यालय बाट माध्यमिक तह उत्तीर्ण गरीसके पछि म नजिकै को सहरमा फुपुसंग बस्दै पढ्न थालें। मेरो फुपुले मलाई उच्च शिक्षा हासिल गर्नमा धेरै मद्दत गर्नुभएको छ।</p>\n<p>तर त्यो बेला उहाँको लागि पनि कठिन समय थियो। कुनै पनि शैक्षिक डिग्रि नभएको एक एकल महिलाका लागि सहरमा आफु अनि आफ्नो सन्तानलाइ पाल्नु, हुर्काउनु, पढाउनु सानो दुख थिएन। उहाँले दिनभर ज्याला मजदुरि गरेर कमाएको पैसाले बिहानबेलुका को छाक टार्न मै ठिक्क हुन्थ्यो।</p>\n<p>त्यसैले म आफैंपनि उहाँमाथि अझ भार थपिन चाहन्नथे। फेरि अर्को तर्फ मेरो बाबाआमा ले पनि त अरु साना बहिनीहरू लाई हेर्नुपर्थ्यो। अब भने मसंग आफ्नो उच्च शिक्षालाइ निरन्तरता दिनको लागि एउटै मात्र बिकल्प थियो &#8211; आफैले कमाएर पढ्ने। यसैकारण मैले एउटा विद्यालयमा पढाउन शुरु गरें।</p>\n<h3>अङ्ग्रेजी भाषाको ज्ञानमार्फत उडान आरम्भ</h3>\n<p>मैले मेरो जीवनको पहिलो जागिर त पाए तर त्यो सोचेजस्तो सजिलो थिएन। मैले शिक्षक को रूपमा एक निजी विद्यालयमा प्रबेश गरे। तर म आफैले भने सरकारी विद्यालयमा पढेको थिए जहाँ नेपाली भाषामा पढाई हुन्थ्यो। हाम्रो कक्षामा अङ्ग्रेजी एउटा मात्र अनिवार्य विषय थियो तर त्यो पनि शिक्षकहरु ले नेपाली भाषामा नै पढाउनु हुन्थ्यो। हामीले कहिल्यै पनि अङ्ग्रेजी भाषा बोलेनौं। यधपी म राम्रो बिध्यार्थीहरु मध्यको एक थिए, जसकारण मेरो अङ्ग्रेजी लेखन भने सामान्यतया राम्रो नै थियो।</p>\n<p>मैले अङ्ग्रेजी शिक्षकको रूपमा पढाउन थालिसके पछि भने मसंग अङ्ग्रेजी सुधार्नु भन्दा अरू कुनै उपाए थिएन। त्यसैले मैले प्राथमिक तहका बिध्यार्थीहरूसँग अङ्ग्रेजीमा बोल्न सुरु गरें। फलस्वरूप एकवर्ष भित्र मेरो अङ्ग्रेजी बोलाईमा धेरै सुधार आयो।</p>\n<p>शिक्षण पेशासंगै मैले मेरो पढाईलाई पनि अगाडि बढाउदै लगें। त्यो बेला मेरो दैनिकि धेरै नै व्यस्त थियो, तर फेरि अर्को विकल्प पनि त थिएन। मेरो तलबले आफ्नो पढाई खर्च जुटाउँदै अलिअलि परिवार लाई पनि सहयोग गर्न थाले। हो यसरी नै मैले ब्याचलर डिग्री पुरा गरें र मास्टर डिग्री पनि शुरु गरें।</p>\n<p>मैले आफ्नो आवश्यकता पुर्ति गर्नको लागि सुरु गरेको शिक्षण पेशाले नै मलाई अङ्ग्रेजी कन्टेन्ट राइटिङ्गको जागिरमा आवेदन दिने साहस दियो। अहिलेको कु्रा गर्ने हो भने, म मेरो अङ्ग्रेजी भाषाको बोलाई र लेखाईसंग केही हदसम्म विश्वस्त छु तर अझै पनि अङ्ग्रेजी नै मातृभाषा भएका बिदेशिहरुका अगाडि बोल्न भने केहि हिच्किचाउछु।</p>\n<h3>मेरो वर्डप्रेस यात्राः स्वतन्त्रता तिर</h3>\n<p>मैले अगाडि नै भनेको जस्तै मेरो पढाईलाई हानी नगर्ने खालको काम खोज्दै गर्दा संयोगवश वर्डप्रेसमा प्रवेश गरेको थिएँ। र यहि बाट नै मेरो स्वतन्त्रता तिर को यात्रा सुरु भएको हो।</p>\n<p>मैले कामको लागि अन्तर्वार्ता दिँदै गर्दा नै <a href=\"https://access-keys.com/\">एक्सेस किइज</a> कम्पनीको प्रमुख (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/athakuri\">अर्जुन सिंह ठकुरी</a>) संग आफ्नो पढाईको लागि चाहिने समयको बारेमा पनि कुरा गरेको थिएँ। उहाँले सजिलैसंग सहमति जनाउनु भयो। फलस्वरूप मैले आफ्नो बिहान को कलेज सकेर ११ बजेदेखि कार्यालय जाने भए जबकि अफिस समय भने ९ः३० बजे नै शुरु हुन्थ्यो। त्यो पल मेरो लागि कृतज्ञता र ठूलो राहतको क्षण थियो।</p>\n<p>एक्सेस किइज कम्पनीमा काम गर्दा नै मैले वर्डप्रेस सिके। <em><strong>पहिलो</strong></em>, विकिपीडिया र अन्य ब्लग हरूलाई धेरै पढे। <em><strong>दोस्रो</strong></em>, नजानेको सानासाना कुराहरू अर्जुन सर र अरू अनुभबी कर्मचारी (डेभलपर, डिजाइनर) हरु संग सोध्थे। र उहाँ हरूले पनि धेरै सहयोग गर्नुहुन्थ्यो। <em><strong>तेस्रो</strong></em>, मैले आफैले वर्डप्रेस डटकम ब्लग स्थापना गरें, परिक्षणका लागि वेबसाइट बनाए र त्यहाँ हरेक कुरा जान्ने र बुझ्ने कोशिस गरे।</p>\n<blockquote><p>अवश्य पनि मेरो जिज्ञासु भावना नै मलाई अगाडि बढाउने शक्ती थियो। यधपी म जस्तो प्राविधिक पृष्ठभूमि नभएको ब्यक्तिलाई वेबसाइट बनाउन सक्ने शक्तिशाली सफ्टवेयर, वर्डप्रेस को बारेमा बुझाउनमा भने वर्डप्रेस आफै सरल हुनु र इन्टरनेटमा प्रशस्ट सामग्रि पाइनुको ठूलो भुमिका छ।</p></blockquote>\n<p>मैले कन्टेन्ट राइटिङ्ग गर्ने क्रमको शुरुवात भने वर्डप्रेस थिमको सुचि बनाउने लेखहरुबाट गरें। सुरूको लेखहरूमा अर्जुन सर नै मेरो सल्लाहकारको रूपमा रहनु भयो। पछि एक्सेस किइज कम्पनीले अनुभबी एसईओ विज्ञ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seonerdy\">अमिन घले</a> लाइ नियुक्ति गर्यो र उहाँले नै मलाई धेरै कुराहरु सिकाउनुभयो। उहा मेरो गुरुका साथै दाई पनि हुनुहुन्छ।</p>\n<p>म एक्सेस किइज कम्पनीमा काम गरिरहेकै बखत पहिलो पटक “<a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">वर्डक्याम्प नेपाल २०१५</a>“ मा सहभागी भए। यो कार्यक्रम भव्य थियो। मैले त्यहाँ वर्डप्रेसमा काम गर्ने नेपालका तथा अन्य देशबाट आएका ब्यक्तिहरुसंग भेटें, उनीहरूको कथा सुने र वर्डप्रेसको बारेमा अझ नयाँनयाँ कुराहरु थाहा पाए।</p>\n<p>म त्यो कार्यक्रमबाट धेरै नै प्रभावित भए र त्यतिबेलानै कुनै दिन वर्डक्याम्पमा वक्तव्य दिने अठोट गरे। नभन्दै मैले अर्को सालको &#8220;<a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016/\">वर्डक्याम्प काठमान्डु २०१६</a>“ मा वक्ता को रूपमा सहभागी भए र “वर्डप्रेसको लागि एसइओ कपिराईटिङ“ शिर्षक मा वक्तव्य दिए।</p>\n<p>पछि फेरि बिराटनगर मा आयोजना भएको “<a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">वर्डक्याम्प बिराटनगर २०१८</a>“ मा पनि सहभागी भए। यसमा म, साथी <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandilyakafle\">गंगा काफ्ले</a> र प्यारी बहिनी <a href=\"https://twitter.com/prithuthakuri\">प्रिठु शिंह थकुरी</a>ले “वर्डप्रेसमा केटीहरुः अनुभव, कथा, अवसर, र चुनौती“ शिर्षक मा छलफल गरेका थियौ। अब भने, मलाई अरु अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय वर्डक्याम्प हरूमा सहभागी हुन मन छ।</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wordcampkathmandu2016speaker-srai-1/\"><img

रमाइलो क्षण\" /></a>\n\n<p>म अझै पनि वर्डप्रेस कन्टेन्ट राइटिङ्ग नै गर्छु।</p>\n<p>मैले एक्सेस किइजमा काम गरिसके पछि नेपालको अर्को सफल कम्पनी थिमग्रिलमा प्रवेश गरे। त्यहाँ अझै धेरै काममा सौलियत र समयमा लचकता थियो। थिमग्रिल कम्पनी का संस्थापक-सन्चालक द्वय <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sanjipshah\">सन्जिप शाह</a> र <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rabinsthaa\">रबिन श्रेष्ठ</a> सरले झन धेरै कुरा सिक्ने हौसला दिनुभयो। केही समय पछाडि कम्पनी ले नयाँनयाँ लेखकहरु ल्यायो र मैले उनीहरूलाई सिकाउन थाले।</p>\n<p>पछि मैले अमेरिकामा अवस्थित अवसम मोटिभ कम्पनीमा पनि काम गरें। सुरु सुरुमा “इजइटडब्लुपि“ र “मन्स्टरइनसाइट्स“ ब्लगमा लेखे र पछि “डब्लुपिबिगिनर“ मा पनि लेख्ने मौका पाएं। म यसै कम्पनीमा काम गरिरहेकै बेला वर्डप्रेस र मार्केटिङ सम्बन्धि अझ धेरै कुरा जान्ने मौका पाए।</p>\n<p>मेरो काममा सुधार आउनुमा मुख्यतया मेरो निरिक्षक <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shahzadsaeed\">साहजाद सइद</a> (भारतबाट), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/noumaan_\">नवमान याकुब</a> (पाकिस्तानबाट), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LittleZotzWrite\">लउरेन थार्प</a> र <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keri_engel\">केरि लिन एन्जेल</a> (अमेरिकाबाट) को धेरै ठूलो भुमिका छ। यतिमात्र हैन कम्पनीको प्रमुख <a href=\"https://twitter.com/syedbalkhi\">शाइद बाल्खि</a> संग काम गर्न पाउनु पनि मेरो लागि भाग्यको कुरा थियो। उहाँले मलाई प्रत्येक हप्ता कन्टेन्ट राइटिङ्ग को बारेमा बिस्तृत रुपमा सिकाउनु हुन्थ्यो। मलाई अझै याद छ उहाँले थुप्रै पटकको संवादमा “सफलताको अन्तर&#8221; को बारेमा सिकाउनु भएको थियो। उहाँ साच्चिकै राम्रो प्रशिक्षक सल्लाहकार हुनुहुन्छ।</p>\n<p>अब अहिलेको कुरा! हाल म वर्डप्रेस लेख लेखन क्षेत्रमा भर्खर आउदै गरेका ब्यक्तिहरु संग काम गर्छु। मैले अहिलेसम्म बटुलेको अनुभवहरु को माध्यमबाट साना वर्डप्रेस विजिनेश र ब्लग लाई सहयोग गर्न खोजिरहेको छु। जस्तो कि म अहिले “साइटसागा डटकम“ र “जाक्राथिम डटकम“ मा कार्यरत छु। यधपि मेरो आफ्नै सिक्ने क्रम भने सदैब जारि नै छ।</p>\n<p>अब भने म आफुलाइ लागेको सबभन्दा महत्वपुर्ण कुरा भन्न चाहान्छ। यो क्षेत्रमा मैले पाएको सबभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण कुरा भनेको “स्वतन्त्रता“ हो।</p>\n<blockquote><p>सर्वप्रथम त मेरो वर्डप्रेसको कामले मलाई समयको स्वतन्त्रता दिलायो। मेरो मतलब यो काम म आफुले भ्याएको समयमा गर्न सक्थे जसले गर्दा मेरो आफ्नै पढाईको लागि समय छुटाउन पाए। अनि दोस्रो कुरा भनेको “आर्थिक स्वतन्त्रता“।</p></blockquote>\n<p>आर्थिक आत्मनिर्भरता प्रत्येक व्यक्तिकालागि स्वतन्त्रता प्राप्तिको एक प्रमुख आधार हो। आम्दानी नै सबै कुरा हो भन्ने त होइन तर यो मानव विकासको एक आधारभुत पक्ष भने अवश्य पनि हो।</p>\n<p>वर्डप्रेसमा मेरो शुरुको तलब ठिकै मात्र थियो तर यसको वृद्धि क्रमशः राम्रो हुदै गयो। उदाहरणका लागि, मैले वर्डक्याम्पमा वक्तव्य दिइसकेपछि भने मलाई अरू पनि धेरै फ्रिल्यान्सिङ्ग काम गर्ने अवसरहरू पाए जुन काम मैले खालि समयमा गर्थे र केही थप पैसा पनि कमाए। त्यसपछि मैले मेरो परिवारलाई पनि राम्ररि सहयोग गर्न थाले।</p>\n<p>अबभने, म स्वतन्त्रता बारे अन्तिम कुरा भन्न चाहान्छु। मलाइ लाग्छ यो स्वतन्त्रताको अनुभुति नै त हो जसले मलाइ यो लेख लेख्न सक्षम बनायो। किनभने मलाइ जहिल्यै पनि लघुताबासले थिचिरहन्थ्यो र आफ्नो परिवार अनि आफ्नो सामाजिक-आर्थिक अवस्थाबारे कसैलाइ पनि भन्न सक्दिनथे या चाहान्नथे। यदि कसैले सोधिहाले पनि, म त्यो प्रश्नलाइ बेवास्ता गर्थे वा ढाटेर जवाफ दिन्थे।</p>\n<p>अहिलेको सन्दर्भको कुरा गर्दा, मैले त्यो परिस्थिति र अरुले के सोच्छन भन्ने डर दुबैमाथि जित हासिल गरेझै लाग्छ। र मलाइ यो नै साचो अर्थमा &#8216;स्वतन्त्रता&#8217; हो जस्तो लाग्छ।</p>\n<p>यही हो मेरो स्वतन्त्रता को कथा! हाम्रो स्वतन्त्रता को कथा!</p>\n<h3>आज राम्रो छ र मसँग अझै ठुला आकांक्षाहरु छन् भविष्यको लागि!</h3>\n<p>हो, मेरो वर्तमान राम्रो छ! वर्डप्रेस कन्टेन्ट राइटर, एडिटर, र सल्लाहाकार रूपमा मेरो करियर राम्रो छ। म एमफिल डिग्री पनि गर्दैछु र छिट्टै पुरा पनि गर्नेछु।</p>\n<p>तर अझपनि भविष्यको लागि मेरा धेरै ठुला आकांक्षाहरु छन्!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>म जे गरिरहेको छु त्यसैलाई निरन्तरता दिन चाहन्छु &#8211; नयाँ लेखकहरुलाई कपिराइटिङ्गको सिप सिकाउदै स्वतन्त्रता को अनुभुति दिलाउन। म जस्तो मान्छेहरू को लागि वर्डप्रेस एक अमुल्य उपहार हो।</li>\n<li>म कुनैदिन विद्यावारिधि गर्न चाहन्छु। यसको लागि यतिबेला भने कुनै योजना बनाएको छैन तर जसरी पनि यसै जुनिमा पुरा गर्ने इच्छा छ।</li>\n<li>म मेरो समुदायलाई सहयोग गर्न चाहन्छु। हाम्रो गाउँमा अझै पनि धेरै परिवर्तन आएको छैन – गरिबीको अवस्था यथावत् नै छ। राम्रो सहयोग प्रणालीको अभावमा अहिले पनि मेरो गाउँका धेरै जसो विद्यार्थीहरु स्नातक तह सम्मको अध्ययन पुरा गर्न सम्म असमर्थ छन्। मलाइ चै ब्यक्ति र समाज सबैको परिवर्तन को लागि शिक्षा एक्दमै महत्वपुर्ण हुन्छ भन्ने कुरामा दृढ विश्वास छ। त्यसैले म यो क्षेत्रमा काम गर्न चाहन्छु, तर कसरी गर्ने भन्ने कुरा भने थाहा छैन! मलाई आशा छ, समयले मेरो प्रश्नको जवाफ अवश्य दिनेछ!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>मेरो कथा पढ्नुभएको यहाँहरु सबैलाई धन्यवाद! मुख्यतः मलाई यो अवसर दिने साथी टोफर लाई धेरै धेरै धन्यवाद! हिरोप्रेसमा मेरो कथा सुनाउन पाउँदा म धेरै नै खुसि छु (आफुलाइ हिरो जस्तै महसुस गरिरहेकोछु)।</p>\n<p>मलाई यो स्थान सम्म पुग्न मद्दत गर्ने सम्पूर्ण व्याक्तीहरूलाई धेरै धेरै धन्यवाद! मैले पाएका सम्पूर्ण चिजहरुको लागि ब्रह्माण्ड लाई धन्यवाद!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/a-journey-toward-freedom-with-wordpress/\">A Journey toward

class=\"has-drop-cap\">You are the team manager at a WordPress development company. You just spent the last couple of months directing the group of highly skilled developers that you oversee to create the latest and greatest block library for WordPress. Your developers just spent those two months recreating what has already been done at least a couple of dozen times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You go through your product launch list:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Testimonial block?</em> Check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Accordion block?</em> Check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Countdown block?</em> Check.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Meme-creation block?</em> Coming in version 2.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything seems to be in order. Your company has a new and shiny wheel, a bullet point on its product list, and a promise to end-users that you are keeping up with the times, launching a set of blocks that they can pick up literally anywhere else. But, yours is better because you built it in-house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Color me unimpressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you are just trying to make a dent in the market, grabbing your share of the pie that companies have been snacking on for the last couple of years. Every time I see another forms plugin, I wonder how they will remain competitive, but there have been success stories. However, the ones who tell those stories always had a fresh take on an old concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worry about the upcoming years when the block market is simply a race to the bottom. Everyone has built their plugin with 100+ blocks, 500+ patterns, and more customization options than you can count. It is the story of the early ThemeForest days where premium themes amassed a gluttonous amount of theme options. The top sellers were continually one-upping each other with another notch on their feature lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a user, developer, and journalist who writes about these products, I am often lost. I look at a new plugin and ask myself if I had already checked it out and dismissed it last week. I am always searching for something innovative, but the lines between one project to the next are blurry. I am swirling in a sea of icon, shape divider, post list, and container blocks &mdash; just looking for a life preserver to pull myself out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I am a wheel recreator myself. I have built products that others had already created. In some cases, I launched something better. In others, I failed miserably. I may be a little biased, but I always felt like I was bringing something new to the table.

There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories that are lesser-known.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Embrace Who You Are and Your Journey</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this People of WordPress contributor story, we chat to Tyler Lau from the US on his relationship building work in marketing and his WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to discover his story which shows it is often what you have learned from negative experiences in your life that can make you a major asset to a product team.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-thumb.jpg?resize=632%2C464&ssl=1\" alt=\"Tyler Lau stood in front of a colorful mural\" class=\"wp-image-10116\" width=\"632\" height=\"464\" />\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>An Entrepreneurial Mindset</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler recalls he always had a knack for spotting a enterprise ideas. As an industrious seven-year-old, he was already finding ways to make sales during the school breaks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many entrepreneurs have similar stories, Tyler’s path took many turns before he discovered and thrived in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was drawn to both the software and the community that surrounds it from his search for personal and professional freedom. He ultimately was able to combine his various business interests and people skills into professional marketing work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Using your skills to uncover your journey</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/people-of-wp-tyler-2.jpg?resize=632%2C758&ssl=1\" alt=\"Tyler Lau pictured sat on a chair using his mobile phone in his social media work\" class=\"wp-image-10118\" width=\"632\" height=\"758\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler’s current role is as a Marketing Relationship Builder, based in Kansas, USA. His responsibilities span across all digital properties and products, leveraging his broad set of business and people skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These skills are amplified by his creativity and adaptability. Tyler says that one reason he is always looking for new projects is his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a diagnosis he received in 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an industry built by programmers and developers who often have a strong sense of focus, Tyler felt that someone with ADHD wouldn’t be seen as a natural fit. He found the WordPress community to be a place where everyone can find the right spot for their unique skills. Tyler’s skill is people, and this has translated into many opportunities and responsibilities in his work life. His skills have also helped him give back to the WordPress community as a speaker and volunteer, and through multiple contributor days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Relationship-building as a career</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of Tyler’s experience was in the restaurant industry, and his resume did not exactly point to a career in tech. But the service industry actually prepared him well for everything he has taken on since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he is at work events, he meets people from across the world and builds connections with them. As an extrovert, he enjoys this and couldn’t imagine a job where he was isolated from getting to know others and relationship-building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding people and being able to operate in any setting are key competencies. Social skills and tact are useful for community building in the WordPress space too, and in Tyler’s life at different times it has been necessary for survival. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The true meaning of freedom</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the WordPress community, the concept of freedom comes up often. WordPress is built on GPL, free software, and open-source values. Practically speaking, anyone can work remotely or be their own boss to gain more freedom in work and life.&nbsp;Tyler feels that he never fitted into a traditional work mould. With his strong focus on freedom, he found this resonated with the freedom and opportunities he believes WordPress provides him and thousands of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler describes how in 2013 his ‘inner opportunist’ got him into trouble. After dropping out of college following a brain aneurysm, he needed capital to fund his first startup.&nbsp;He shares that he found a quick but unlawful way to make money. Alongside this between shifts as a waiter, he worked on prototypes for his first product. The company was growing fast, and to protect his patents and take research and development to the next level, he had to work hard. Everything came to a halt when some of the actions he took resulted in being sent to prison.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says that meeting other inmates reminded him that he was in a much better situation than most. He was educated, well-off, loved, and knew he had a future once he was released. He found that many inmates never graduated from high school and were computer illiterate. While inside, Tyler taught subjects like science, math, writing, reading, and social studies. He found that due to the lack of skills and support, many inmates would struggle upon release. He believes getting the mental health support and job training needed to thrive after prison is not easy for many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>There’s more to freedom than just being on the outside. You also need a sense of agency and enfranchisement,</em>” says Tyler. He considered his sense of purpose and support network were plenty to keep him going and was ready to take on his next (legal) business challenge as soon as he could.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Going forward positively&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/04/FF50DF21-38AA-4778-B465-C2DF0B441AD7.jpeg?resize=632%2C632&ssl=1\" alt=\"Tyler Lau portrait picture\" class=\"wp-image-10139\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The idea that your past doesn’t define you and you can choose to embrace it, is a key driver for Tyler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He describes himself as an outlier in many ways. He recalls how politics influenced his life from the day he was born. Tyler’s father is a semi-dissident Chinese visual anthropologist, his mother is an art professor who left her home country of Japan to break free from traditional Japanese gender roles. Tyler feels he inherited a lot of this fearlessness.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>I’ve never fitted in, and yet this is what makes me able to adapt to most situations and relate to just about anyone. I embrace my eclectic, dissonant past and see beauty in the person those experiences shaped me to be</em>,” says Tyler.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, he’s able to put those skills to good use in the WordPress community and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says: “<em>Regardless of your physical abilities, mental health struggles, upbringing, and even your run-ins with the law, no one is excluded from carving their place in the WordPress industry</em>”.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tyler Lau (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/tylermaximus/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>tylermaximus</a>) for sharing his #ContributorStory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\">@lmurillom</a>), Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>), Olga Gleckler (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/oglekler/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>oglekler</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>yvettesonneveld</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>) for working on the People of WordPress series.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y3odYTyvSfJbVxUxUWEgKxOprox2zxVwhk7_vdW-AIs4IlE-jK0Zt1itCj867x0dIAbIiK-VeuTLMZr6BjNEY0fkTf--4dT1hkLbnGtsPFNfyrVBYIN59IirTkNnqiQgqxk6E1MI\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\"><em>Topher DeRosia</em></a><em>.

His historical, legal and technical acumen on free software is unrivaled. He has a deep sensitivity to the ways that technologies can contribute to both the enhancement and the diminution of basic human rights. His global network of connections is invaluable. He remains the most articulate philosopher and an unquestionably dedicated advocate of freedom in computing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The board took responsibility for bungling the news of his election to a board seat, stating that the planned flow of information was not executed in a timely manner. When Stallman <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/free-software-community-condemns-richard-stallmans-reinstatement-to-fsf-board-of-directors\">announced his return to the board</a> at last month&rsquo;s LibrePlanet event, the free software community was not able to discern whether he did so with the board&rsquo;s permission. It took the FSF by surprise, polarized the community, and provoked organizations and corporations to publish statements condemning his reinstatement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The board admits that &ldquo;FSF staff should have been informed and consulted first,&rdquo; but follows it up by effectively downplaying his influence, stating that Stallman is &ldquo;an unpaid volunteer and subject to the organization&rsquo;s policies.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement reads like a perplexing love letter for someone who struggles with social cues. It obscures most of the real issues outlined in an <a href=\"https://rms-open-letter.github.io/\">open letter</a> signed by many prominent members of the free software community.  The FSF board referenced a <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/rms-addresses-the-free-software-community\">statement</a> from Stallman, published one minute prior, and claims that he has acknowledged his mistakes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;He has sincere regrets, especially at how anger toward him personally has negatively impacted the reputation and mission of FSF. While his personal style remains troubling for some, a majority of the board feel his behavior has moderated and believe that his thinking strengthens the work of the FSF in pursuit of its mission.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The FSF board has officially confirmed that the majority of its leadership advocated for Stallman&rsquo;s return and see it as important in its aim &ldquo;to attract a new generation of activists for software freedom and to grow the movement.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/rms-addresses-the-free-software-community\">Stallman&rsquo;s statement</a> identifies his past behaviors as something outside his control, saying it was &ldquo;not a choice&rdquo; and &ldquo;unavoidable:&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Later in life, I discovered that some people had negative reactions to my behavior, which I did not even know about. Tending to be direct and honest with my thoughts, I sometimes made others uncomfortable or even offended them &mdash; especially women. This was not a choice: I didn&rsquo;t understand the problem enough to know which choices there were.</p><p>Sometimes I lost my temper because I didn&rsquo;t have the social skills to avoid it. Some people could cope with this; others were hurt. I apologize to each of them. Please direct your criticism at me,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/statement-of-fsf-board-on-election-of-richard-stallman\">not at the Free Software Foundation</a>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He also attempted to explain his position regarding the 2019 controversy that prompted his <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gpl-author-richard-stallman-resigns-from-free-software-foundation\">resignation from the FSF board</a> and MIT&rsquo;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;It was right for me to talk about the injustice to Minsky, but it was tone-deaf that I didn&rsquo;t acknowledge as context the injustice that Epstein did to women or the pain that caused.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve learned something from this about how to be kind to people who have been hurt. In the future, that will help me be kind to people in other situations, which is what I hope to do.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategically intertwined pair of statements from Stallman and the FSF did little to change the community&rsquo;s perception of his reinstatement to the board. They seemed to have the opposite effect of inflaming those who opposed it in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really grateful that the FSF board took the time to clarify this,&rdquo; Tock founder Brian Fitzpatrick <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therealfitz/status/1381656583554404353\">said</a>. &ldquo;This makes it crystal clear that they would rather have RMS around than become an inclusive and welcoming environment to more than half the people who write software. Toxic to the core.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations on getting RMS offering a non-apology for being tone deaf.

More recently that includes his controversial remarks on rape, assault,&nbsp;and child sex trafficking, along with two decades of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman\">behaviors and statements</a>&nbsp;that many have found to be disturbing and offensive. Whether these behaviors are motivated by malice or simply a lack of understanding the proper context, the damage to the FSF continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Hat principle engineer Elana Hashman, former director of the Open Source Initiative, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ehashdn/status/1381665600846528515\">published a thread</a> with suggestions for 501(c)(3) public charities the community can donate to as an alternative to the FSF, including The Software Freedom Conservancy, EFF, OSI, and Software in the Public Interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week we <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fsf-doubles-down-on-stallman-reinstatement-wordpress-does-not-support-his-return-to-the-board\">reported</a> that the WordPress project does not support Stallman&rsquo;s return to the FSF board of directors. Curiously, WordPress&rsquo; executive director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy published the <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/2021/04/02/on-recent-news-about-the-fsf-board-of-directors/\">statement</a> to her personal blog instead of on the project&rsquo;s website, but she confirmed it is WordPress&rsquo; official stance on Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement. Since that time, the <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/\">WordPress Foundation</a> has quietly removed the Free Software Foundation from its list of inspirations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many corporations and individuals have distanced themselves and pulled funding from the FSF, but it has not had much impact on the leadership of the organization. The FSF board seems confident in their decision to keep Stallman in place, despite openly admitting that &ldquo;his personal style remains troubling.&rdquo; When the organization&rsquo;s actions so sublimely repudiate its stated goals (to attract a new generation of activists for software freedom), it&rsquo;s easy to see why former supporters can no longer buy into the FSF&rsquo;s promises to improve transparency and accountability.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 03:53:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Display Digital Sheet Music With the WordPress Block Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=115022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:183:\"https://wptavern.com/display-digital-sheet-music-with-the-wordpress-block-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=display-digital-sheet-music-with-the-wordpress-block-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4520:\"<img />OSMD plugin output on the front end.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">PhonicScore, a company out of Vienna, recently released its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/opensheetmusicdisplay/\">OpenSheetMusicDisplay (OSMD) plugin</a>.

To add the &lsquo;out-of-the-box features&rsquo; and get it working we used WordPress&rsquo;s framework/library &mdash; Javascript and PHP.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the type of plugin that allows the beauty of the block editor to shine. A few years ago, such a feat would only have been possible via the shortcode system.  Users would have had to manually type in all of the shortcode&rsquo;s arguments &mdash; assuming they could remember them all &mdash; and preview the post to see what it would look like. Today, they can interact with and make changes directly to their sheet music&rsquo;s display from the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OSMD was never a WordPress-first project. It was a standalone library that the company decided to make available to WordPress. With the power of the block system, they were able to do that. One can only hope that we see investments in our community from similar projects now that the block editor has become more stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are barely digging beneath the surface of what will be possible in time. Blocks like OSMD build upon the optimism I had when the system was first unveiled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use the plugin, users must simply insert the OpenSheetMusicDisplay block into their content canvas. It is located under the Embed category. From that point, they must select or upload an XML file via the block options sidebar (<code>.xml</code>, <code>.musicxml</code>, and <code>.mxl</code> files are supported). Dragging and dropping a file does not work in this version &mdash; <em>maybe a feature request for 2.0?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img />OSMD block in the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Basic Options&rdquo; tab has several width and aspect ratio settings. For the most part, it is probably best to leave these at the defaults. However, this will depend on your theme and how much room it provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block does not currently support the standard wide-alignment system. Instead, it has a width option, allowing users to determine the front-end output. Because this is a non-standard option, it may not play well with all themes. Depending on how the user&rsquo;s active theme handles content width, they can get wildly different results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Drawing Options&rdquo; tab is where users have more control over customizing the output. These settings allow users to determine what is &ldquo;drawn&rdquo; in the digital sheet music. One option is whether to draw the composer&rsquo;s name. Another is to output time signatures. With 10 settings in total, there is a lot to tinker with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest issue I ran into with the plugin was with the editor freezing from time to time. It appeared that the block was trying to reload, even when I was working outside of it. This happened despite having unticked the &ldquo;Automatically Rerender on Change&rdquo; checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this plugin should serve users who want to display sheet music well. It is simple to use and offers numerous customization options. The team has a <a href=\"https://opensheetmusicdisplay.github.io/demo/\">demo of the OSMD library</a> in action on their site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are not inclined to share digital sheet music, well, we can all appreciate the genius of J.S. Bach&rsquo;s <em>Air</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 21:16:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WordPress Foundation: Announcement: Upcoming live discussion on do_action charity hackathons\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=184010\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2021/announcement-upcoming-live-discussion-on-do_action-charity-hackathons/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4712:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This live discussion has concluded.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first episode of this podcast, I said that there&#8217;s a lot that goes into WordPress, that&#8217;s really hard to see. One of the hardest things to see about the WordPress project as you get started is the overall structure. There is quite a bit of documentation that can clarify the basics: the names of teams, what they work on, and where, and when they meet. The way that they influence and support each other can really feel like a bit of a mystery. So today, I&#8217;m going to break down the WordPress community into five big groups; I want you to keep a couple of things in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, these are high-level and based on my observations. Each of these groups can be further broken down into subgroups. So while you may not feel represented in this exact five, you are included if you were to dig a little bit deeper. The second thing to keep in mind is that the makeup of these groups is pretty fluid. Many community members find themselves in more than one group, but generally not far off. Some group two folks end up in group three, depending on the situation, people in group four can also end up in group five, and so on. As with so many things that I share, I&#8217;m not trying to insist that one size fits all. I&#8217;m not trying to put the WordPress community into a box. This is just a basic framework to understand how it all fits together. Alright, are you ready? I&#8217;m ready. Let&#8217;s do it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I have a broad definition of the community, which I have mentioned before. I believe that the community is anyone who has interacted with WordPress, whether they know it or not. So, I&#8217;ll start from way out there and work my way in that first group; we’re going to call our <strong>Visitors</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visitors</strong> are people who arrive at a WordPress site to gain information or engage in an activity. Sometimes they know it&#8217;s a WordPress site, but most of the time, they don&#8217;t. The second group are <strong>Users</strong>, people who use WordPress as their CMS. So, that&#8217;s website builders, website designers, small businesses, content creators, and the list goes on and on. The third group I like to refer to is the <strong>Extenders</strong>. Those are people who extend WordPress through the creation of blocks, themes, plugins, and more. There are also people who teach WordPress to others through WordPress podcasts, and newsletters and tutorials. The fourth group I refer to as our <strong>Contributors</strong> is the people who contribute to the open source software and the infrastructure supporting it, but not necessarily the same people who contribute directly to their own product. And then there&#8217;s group five, <strong>Leaders</strong>. Those are people who help drive the vision and strategy for WordPress; the most notable member of that group is of course, Matt Mullenweg. And I&#8217;m also in that group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these groups directly influenced the groups on either side. For example, a WordPress user is affected by both visitors and extenders. Imagine a content creator who shares their passion for photography through a WordPress site; this photographer may have visitors that need to purchase photos. In response, the user now has a need to make it possible for visitors to purchase photos on a site. So they go to what we consider the extenders, people who have built a plugin that supports that need. And as a result, that user can install that on their site. And they have have satisfied the need of the visitors to their site, the people who now can purchase photos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of examples like this in the WordPress project. Every small pattern that you see is mirrored in the larger patterns across our ecosystem. And every large pattern you see in the ecosystem can be seen among our teams. It&#8217;s pretty cool to look at really. So, why should this matter to you? From a very practical standpoint, this matters for anyone who&#8217;s trying to learn more about contributing to the WordPress project. These five groups mirror very closely the five steps of volunteer engagement that we see across the ecosystem and from a more philosophical standpoint, it&#8217;s just kind of nice to know who your neighbors are. Without the influence and support of the groups around us, it can be hard to know whether we&#8217;re on the right track or not. So take a look to your left and look to your right, and get to know your partners in this project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our community highlight, the segment where I share a note about contributors who have helped others along the way, or WordPress success story. This week&#8217;s highlight is from @CoachBirgit, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/coachbirgit/\">Birgit Olzem</a>, a longtime contributor and a friend of mine. Her success story goes like this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has allowed me as a mother of five to leave a toxic marriage for good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, the community picked me up when I became seriously ill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can say from the bottom of my heart, that working with WordPress has saved my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got three things for you this week. I think that they&#8217;re all very important. And I hope you check them all out. The first one is a reminder that word camp Central America is coming up on April 15 and 16th. If you have not registered for tickets, you still have time, I will share a link to the registration page and the schedule in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list of big things is that the Gutenberg 10.4 release is coming out later this week on April 14th. It&#8217;s an important release because it&#8217;s when we take a look at the current iteration of full site editing tools that we have, and decide if it&#8217;s ready to get into the WordPress 5.8 release. There&#8217;s a post that has a little more information about that which I will share in the show notes below as well. If you haven&#8217;t checked out the Gutenberg plugin lately, obviously I think it&#8217;s a good idea to do that in general, but definitely a good idea to check it out now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing on our list today is a reminder to check out our most recent block pattern tutorial, I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes. It&#8217;s this kind of tips and tricks, tutorial, the “show me how to do it,” kind of thing in the style of <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-style-guides/\">CSS-Tricks</a>. If you or anyone that you know might be interested in sharing a similar style of tutorial, there&#8217;s a link to a form in that show notes as well so that you can share with us your name and the topic that you&#8217;re interested in. We&#8217;ll take a look and see if it&#8217;s something that we definitely need to make sure our users know how to do. So, that my friends is your small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:36:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Set Up a Gutenberg Test Site in 2 Minutes with the Gutenberg Nightly Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114098\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:215:\"https://wptavern.com/set-up-a-gutenberg-test-site-in-2-minutes-with-the-gutenberg-nightly-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=set-up-a-gutenberg-test-site-in-2-minutes-with-the-gutenberg-nightly-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4142:\"<p>WordPress contributors are working towards landing full site editing (FSE) sometime this year, an ambitious plan that will require all hands on deck for testing. A meeting of a small group of core leads on April 14 will start the process of deciding whether FSE will land in version 5.8. In the meantime, the FSE outreach program has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\">extended the deadline for the fourth round of testing</a> until April 12. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the quickest ways to get started doing alpha/beta testing is to install the Gutenberg Nightly plugin, which pulls in the latest build from the Gutenberg project. Ordinarily, to get the latest build one would have to install NodeJS and npm and use the command line to get set up. This process can be prohibitive, along with the dizzying pace of Gutenberg development, for less technical users who want to start testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg Nightly plugin, combined with the GitHub Updater plugin completely automates the process of grabbing the latest zip from Gutenberg trunk, and users will be notified when a new nightly is available for updating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Set Up a Gutenberg Nightly Test Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/#nightly\">download</a> and install the Gutenberg Nightly plugin by uploading the zip file. If you already have the stable version of the Gutenberg plugin, you will be prompted to replace the current version with the one you are uploading. If you want to get updates when a new nightly is available, download and install the <a href=\"https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/releases/latest\">GitHub Updater</a> plugin the same way. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Gutenberg Nightly update available</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing the full-site editing project will require you to install a theme like TT1 Blocks, which has support for the experimental feature. Once you do, you will see the &ldquo;Site Editor (beta)&rdquo; menu item in the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I set up a Gutenberg testing environment in 2 minutes using these plugins. Please note that it&rsquo;s not recommended to use Gutenberg Nightly in production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack, publisher of the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/\">Gutenberg Times</a>, created the plugin in October 2020, to help testers keep up with the rapid pace of Gutenberg development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;On October 19, 2020, there were 250 new commits made since the last release (9.1.1) and before the release of 9.2,&rdquo; Pauli-Haack said. &ldquo;Any issue you might file, might get a response like &lsquo;Could you please try it in master, I think it was already fixed.\'&rdquo; This slows down the testing process and can be discouraging to testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pauli-Haack creates the build every day as a volunteer service to facilitate Gutenberg testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At the beginning it took a bit longer but now I wrote a small <a href=\"https://github.com/bph/distribute-nightly\">Node CLI script</a> that does the distribution to GitHub and uploads it to the GT site as well, so the button Download gives you the newest version,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In October, I was a total rookie with an idea.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pauli-Haack credits Andy Fragen, author of the GitHub Updater plugin, and Riad Benguella, a technical lead on the Gutenberg project, who helped her past some skill gaps in getting the process more automated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Andy Fragen helped me think through it for making it the easiest for the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; users to get a Test version without to know much about git, node and stuff,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg Nightly has facilitated more than 62,000 downloads to date. The repository for the plugin has <a href=\"https://github.com/bph/gutenberg/discussions/\">discussions</a> enabled so users can stay updated with major changes, make feature requests, and <a href=\"https://github.com/bph/gutenberg/discussions/3\">participate in Q&amp;A</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 16:12:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Gutenberg Times: Full-Site Editing Scope in WordPress 5.8.

After the launch of Gutenberg 10.4 on April 14, a small group of core leads will participate in a go/no-go demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following people will be on the call:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Matias Ventura &ndash; Gutenberg Project Lead who will host the demo.</li><li>Matt Mullenweg &ndash; WordPress Project Lead.</li><li>Helen Hou-Sand&igrave; &ndash; Lead Developer.</li><li>Josepha Haden Chomphosy &ndash; Executive Director.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The meeting&rsquo;s agenda is simple. Ventura will host the demo, and the group will discuss and cover implementation questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are no blockers, they will share a plan for merging FSE into WordPress. The more likely outcome is that they will find at least a few items that must be addressed. In that case, they will share these publicly with a plan to tackle them before a second go/no-go date of April 27.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first beta release of WordPress 5.8 is set for June 8, with a general public release for July 20. The team needs to decide on inclusion early in the release cycle to give theme and plugin developers time to prepare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many are on their toes awaiting a final decision, everyone needs to have a little patience at the moment. Everything needs to be carefully weighed by the project leaders. There is a good chance we will not know the outcome until that second, April 27 deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the FSE transition would be a beta run for a subset users. Including these features in core does not mean that WordPress immediately flips the switch and enables everything for 40% of the web. For the overall FSE experience, users must make an explicit choice to install and activate a block-based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, the onboarding experience should be a welcoming one that invites users into site editing while letting them know the potential issues. If it is a built-in beta, they <em>really</em> need to understand that improvements are forthcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An in-core beta run like this is also welcome, given the project&rsquo;s launch of the block editor a couple of years ago. Regardless of whether people loved or hated the block editor, the rollout was not smooth for everyone. WordPress dropped end-users into an overhauled system, which was a shocking change for many. The project has a chance to do better this time around by incrementally introducing features to users and allowing others to immerse themselves in the new experience of their own choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The most important context to share is that <strong>it isn&rsquo;t shipping as the full, default experience for users</strong>,&rdquo; wrote Chomphosy in the post, noting that the team is growing beyond past mistakes. &ldquo;One of the clearest pieces of feedback from the Phase One merge process was that there wasn&rsquo;t enough time for our extenders (agencies, theme authors, plugin developers, site builders, etc.) to prepare for the upcoming changes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision-makers may also decide to ship some pieces but not others. FSE is a project made up of several components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The whole full site editing project is sort of an umbrella term for a collection of tools and projects, so it would be possible for some pieces to ship while others don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Haden Chomphosy. &ldquo;There are probably some exceptions to that, as you mentioned, but many of these can ship as they are ready.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exceptions she was referring to are components that make more sense together. For example, block-based themes via a <code>theme.json</code> config file and most of the site-editing blocks are not as useful when separate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are cases where something like the Query block could be used outside of the site editor. Users might create custom queries within a page without the benefit of the site editor, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My primary concern is not with features related to the site editor but with block-based widgets. It is a transitional tool for users on traditional themes. Along with the new nav menus screen, it is not a part of the block-based themes experience. The goal is to allow users to start using blocks in more places. However, this will result in a broken UX in many cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The widgets experience is still <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/are-block-based-widgets-ready-to-land-in-wordpress-5-6\">partially broken</a>, treating each block as a separate widget. Users must learn to put a Heading (widget title) and another block (widget content) into a Group (widget wrapper) for the correct widget-related classes on the front end of the site. For some themes, whether users do this will be a non-issue. For others, it will look ugly at best and break the layout at worst. Putting this responsibility on the shoulders of end-users was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/25174#issuecomment-708238689\">deemed an acceptable solution</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to focus on this issue because it is one of those things that may simply be flipped on for all users. I am still afraid that transitioning from a functioning system to a potentially broken one will make for a bumpy ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress 5.6 release team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-6-release-team-pulls-the-plug-on-block-based-widgets\">decided not to ship</a> block-based widgets. Hou-Sand&igrave;, as the core tech lead for 5.6, provided a historical account of the decision and why it was not ready for inclusion:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>My question for features that affect the front-end is &ldquo;can I try out this new thing without the penalty of messing up my site?&rdquo; &mdash; that is, user trust. At this current moment, given that widget areas are not displayed anything like what you see on your site without themes really putting effort into it and that you have to save your changes live without revisions to get an actual contextual view, widget area blocks do not allow you to try this new feature without penalizing you for experimenting.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While widgets have arguably improved, I still see the answer as being the same as last October.

Originally founded in 2008 as a themes company, iThemes became more of a plugin-oriented business over the years before it was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/liquid-web-acquires-ithemes-in-multi-million-dollar-deal\">acquired by Liquid Web in 2018</a>. The company is returning to its roots with this acquisition and plans to make Kadence WP the official theme platform of choice for iThemes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret that the &lsquo;themes&rsquo; part of iThemes has been lacking for many years now,&rdquo; iThemes general manager Matt Danner said. &ldquo;While we got our start in WordPress themes in 2008, over the past 10 years, we pivoted to the more obvious needs of our customers (mainly WordPress security, backups, memberships and maintenance) as the theme marketplace got more competitive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;</em>Joining forces with Kadence WP means that iThemes can once again have an innovative and modern WordPress theme platform.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iThemes announced it will be sunsetting its <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/purchase/builder-theme/\">iThemes Builder theme framework</a> and all of its legacy themes in 2022, in favor of supporting the Kadence theme which already has more than 50,000 active installations. Danner said the older themes &ldquo;are no longer truly compatible with the future direction of WordPress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadence Blocks are even more popular than the accompanying theme, since they can be used in combination with any WordPress theme. The plugin has gained more than 100,000 users after its initial launch in August 2018. Kadence Blocks <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-and-plugin-shops-are-pioneering-the-first-layout-blocks-for-gutenberg\">pioneered some of the first full-featured layout blocks</a> in the early days of Gutenberg prior to its inclusion in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This last year has marked some ridiculous growth for Kadence WP,&rdquo; co-founder Ben Ritner said. &ldquo;Only one year ago my sister Hannah (many users will know Hannah from our support channels) and I were the entirety of&nbsp;the Kadence WP team. It is hard to gauge user numbers with accuracy because of how many free products we have, but the amount of people using Kadence WP products has roughly quadrupled in the last 10 months! Our new Kadence Theme, which landed on the repo in November (only 160 days ago), now has more than 50,000 active users.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadence WP will continue running under its same branding and as a separate company under the iThemes brand. Pricing will remain the same for existing Kadence WP customers. iThemes plans to raise its prices for its Agency Bundle on May 1, 2021, but renewal pricing will remain the same as long as the customers&rsquo; subscriptions auto-renew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadence Blocks is adding dynamic content for its pro version in the next month. The team is also launching a new plugin called Kadence Cloud, which will allow users to create a pre-built cloud of content that they can pull down into any website. Both Kadence Blocks and the theme will also be rolling in many of the top-voted feature requests from its community. A major new product release is planned for Q4 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iThemes will be hosting a <a href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8329602538499610384\">townhall meeting</a> Friday, April 9 at 11:00 am CST to address any questions or concerns that users and customers may have.

Large news organizations have kicked them to the curb. Frustrated bloggers who no longer desire all of the hassles with moderation shut down their forms. The conversations have moved to corporate-controlled social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is hard to pinpoint the exact moment much of the web devolved into chaos. It was probably more of a gradual thing. The tools that we built fostered the darkest side of humanity. Far too often, people let out their worst unfiltered thoughts without regard to decency and kindness. If we dig deep enough, social media is likely the culprit that spawned this growing experience. However, it is also entrenched in the blogging world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, with the ubiquity of mobile phones, everyone has a voice. And, far too often, the vocal minority drives the masses from discussion to ad hominem. Or, maybe the majority was always looking for a justification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a bright side. Commenting on and discussing ideas in an open forum can change hearts and minds. It can lead to discoveries and create life-long friendships &mdash; I still routinely chat with people I met through blogs and their comments from nearly two decades ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan McCue, a core contributor to WordPress, said that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmccue/status/1375873040496594946\">comments should be a plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are few things I could think that would hurt the blogging community more. Comments are the lifeblood of many WordPress-built sites. Without them as part of the core experience, how many new users will venture out to find a commenting plugin? Such a change would sign the death warrant for commenting on a large part of the web, moving more discussion away from blogs into the waiting arms of social networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCue&rsquo;s response was to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/1375867036102971396\">tweet by Brian Krogsgard</a>, the Post Status creator and editor. &ldquo;WordPress should have one singular button that says: Turn off all comments and comment displays. This is so hilariously complicated, it&rsquo;s absurd.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is not wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress comment settings screen is so complex that I rarely change anything other than a setting or two, even when I want comments enabled for a site. There are around two dozen individual options on that screen, and none of them just allow users to turn it all off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric Karkovack explores this same topic in his piece for Speckyboy titled <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/is-the-wordpress-comment-system-still-relevant/\">Is the WordPress Comment System Still Relevant?</a> He concluded:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>So, where does this leave the default comment system? It still offers the basics and can be extended. Yet it seems a bit antiquated when compared to what other services are offering. To remain a compelling option, improvements are in order.</p><p>There&rsquo;s certainly no harm in keeping it around. But, short of a renewed effort to improve the out-of-the-box functionality, perhaps it shouldn&rsquo;t be as front-and-center within WordPress as it is now.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has failed to iterate on its commenting feature in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Like most things, [Full Site Editing] will change things there,&rdquo; wrote WordPress Themes Team rep Ari Stathopoulos in the Post Status Slack. &ldquo;Want comments? Add the comment-form block in your template. Don&rsquo;t want them? Don&rsquo;t add it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that is partly true, it only handles things on the front end of the site. All the commenting-related features would still be there in the admin. However, it is a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to easily opt in or out of a commenting system is merely one change that needs to happen. Something as basic as an <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33627\">in-context comment list view</a> is a must for easier moderation. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier\">Tavern still uses</a> Stephen Cronin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/\">Show Comment Parent</a> plugin for this. Even a basic JavaScript-based front-end submission form would go a long way toward modernizing the commenting system. Does anyone enjoy a full page reload when leaving a comment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is more that we could be doing. For a platform that prides itself on democratizing publishing and owning your content, a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35435\">ticket for supporting webmentions</a> has had virtually no movement in five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Webmention is a standardized protocol for mentions and conversations across the web. It is a part of a goal for a decentralized social &ldquo;network&rdquo; of sorts where everyone owns and controls their content. While the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/\">Webmention plugin</a> by Matthias Pfefferle takes care of this feature, universal adoption would be a far more realistic goal as part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should also have some serious conversations about what tools publishers need to build thriving communities via their comments. For example, is comment moderation easy enough? If not, what can we do to improve it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is more than simply a blogging platform. Users can build any kind of site they want today, with or without the comments. However, commenting is part of the software&rsquo;s history and identity. It is a gateway to discussion &mdash; often as important or even more so than a site&rsquo;s content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments will always be relevant. Whether it is a response to a blog post, tweet, Slack thread, or some new thing we have yet to think of, the web is all about connecting and communicating with others. We should constantly reevaluate whether WordPress is leading the pack, creating the tools to enable more discussion.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 23:11:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"HeroPress: Hallway Chats Joins The HeroPress Family\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=3524\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:147:\"https://heropress.com/hallway-chats-joins-the-heropress-family/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hallway-chats-joins-the-heropress-family\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2413:\"<img width=\"375\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hallway-chats-logotype-v01.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Original Hallway Chats logo\" />\n<p>As any parent or pet owner knows, quiet doesn&#8217;t always equal inactivity.

These would launch alongside Full Site Editing&rsquo;s inclusion in WordPress, which could be as soon as version 5.8 &mdash; no hard decision has been made on that yet. Some may not end up bundled directly in WordPress but could be included in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-initial-designs-for-wordpress-block-pattern-directory\">upcoming pattern directory</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-2-adds-spacers-to-navigation-lists-lets-users-categorize-template-parts-and-introduces-scoped-patterns\">Gutenberg 10.2</a> introduced a new feature called &ldquo;scoped patterns.&rdquo; This system allows developers to build block patterns within a specific context instead of always being available from the inserter. Specifically, the Gutenberg development team created a handful of patterns for the Query block. When inserting the block, users can choose between each of these patterns as a starting point for outputting their posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Pattern selections for the Query block in its initial state.\n\n\n\n<p>The patterns are far too generic and do not come close to replicating the array of design options in the real world. While the end goal is to not cover every scenario imaginable, WordPress should ultimately give users a little more flexibility as a jumping-off point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Those were always meant to be temporary to start with,&rdquo; wrote Kjell Reigstad, a core WordPress contributor and Design Director at Automattic, in the GitHub ticket. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take another look at these, both to replace the current ones for now, but also so that we eventually have a nice set of WordPress community-designed query block patterns to add to the Pattern Directory at launch.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors will be able to release their own scoped patterns for the Query block too. However, with block-based themes being few and far between at this phase of the project, WordPress needs to set the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the reasons I was so vocal pre-WordPress 5.5 about the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/decision-time-what-block-patterns-should-ship-with-wordpress-5-5\">early pattern designs</a>, and it is why I was happy to see them <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-8-7-adds-minor-changes-updates-block-pattern-designs-and-continues-full-site-editing-work\">overhauled before the launch</a>. Many users need that bit of inspiration, that push to try out alternate layouts instead of building them on their own. They need options beyond the typical stacked blog posts layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few well-designed Query patterns do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to try my hand at building what I think would be a fun Query pattern to use:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query block pattern with full-width background image.\n\n\n\n<p>I built this using core blocks instead of the Query block with the Eksell theme installed. Side note: let me just reiterate my earlier <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/compatibility-is-not-enough-the-eksell-wordpress-theme-creates-art-with-blocks\">review of Eksell</a>. It is such a well-rounded design that anyone can create all sorts of custom patterns. It makes for an easy-to-use testbed for exploring design concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea was based on a pattern that Mel Choyce-Dwan shared in the ticket:</p>\n\n\n\n<img /> Query block pattern with background image and centered text. \n\n\n\n<p>I do not think it is currently possible to build this Query pattern idea with the site editor. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to use the post featured image as a background or within the Cover block, a common layout design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, the site editor should get to the point where theme authors can move at least a hair beyond the basics. It will take some time for the tooling to catch up, but we are approaching the point where designers can build more complex things. That is another reason theme authors should be involved with this discussion. It needs input and ideas from themers who are out there dealing with users in real-world settings.

They can&#8217;t even come up with original concepts for attack ads, and have tried to rip-off of Apple&#8217;s Mac vs PC ads, but tastelessly personify the WordPress community as an absent, drunken father in a therapy session. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png\" alt=\"🤔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a lot of empathy for whoever was forced to work on these ads, including the actors, it must have felt bad working on something that&#8217;s<strong> like Encyclopedia Britannica attacking Wikipedia</strong>. WordPress is a global movement of hundreds of thousands of volunteers and community members, coming together to make the web a better place. The code, and everything you put into it, belongs to you, and its open source license ensures that you&#8217;re in complete control, now and forever. WordPress is free, and also gives you freedom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix is a for-profit company with a valuation that peaked at around 20 billion dollars, and whose business model is getting customers to pay more and more every year and making it difficult to leave or <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.wix.com?aspects=refund\">get a refund</a>. (Don&#8217;t take my word for it, look at their investor presentations.) They are so insecure that they are also the only website creator I&#8217;m aware of that doesn&#8217;t allow you to export your content, so they&#8217;re like a roach motel where you can check in but never check out. Once you buy into their proprietary stack you&#8217;re locked in, which even their support documentation admits:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So if we&#8217;re comparing website builders to abusive relationships, Wix is one that locks you in the basement and doesn&#8217;t let you leave.</strong> I&#8217;m surprised consumer protection agencies haven&#8217;t gone after them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Philosophically, I believe in open source, and if WordPress isn&#8217;t a good fit for you there are other great open source communities like Drupal, Joomla, Jekyll, and Typo3. We also have a great relationship with some of our proprietary competitors, and I have huge respect for the teams at Shopify and Squarespace, and even though we compete I&#8217;ve always seen them operate with integrity and I&#8217;d recommend them without hesitation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to believe that users will care about that in the long run, and maybe that&#8217;s <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y\">why Squarespace just passed up Wix in market share</a>. They <a href=\"https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206566687-Exporting-your-site\">natively support exporting into WordPress&#8217; format</a> and don&#8217;t have to resort to dirty tricks to be successful. I expect Squarespace&#8217;s upcoming IPO will be a great one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix, though, continues to show their true colors. Regardless of their product, I hope people consider the behavior of companies in the world they support with their dollars. Wix really wants you to see their new campaign though, so let&#8217;s take the bait and watch the creepy, misleading way they are trying to represent themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 17:34:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: Wix’s Negative Advertising Campaign Falls Flat with WordPress Developers and Professionals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114772\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:243:\"https://wptavern.com/wixs-negative-advertising-campaign-falls-flat-with-wordpress-developers-and-professionals?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wixs-negative-advertising-campaign-falls-flat-with-wordpress-developers-and-professionals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5971:\"<p>Wix has launched a negative advertising campaign targeting WordPress, following a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wix-takes-a-jab-at-wordpress-with-bewildering-new-marketing-campaign\">bizarre marketing stunt</a> where the company shipped out Bose headphones to influential WordPress community members. Recipients were puzzled, because it appeared the company was wasting its marketing budget on people who were not likely to be swayed by the campaign. Wix seems oblivious to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danyork/status/1379128016387866624\">negative </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1379570402347864066\">responses</a> to its headphones marketing ploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Like, these are nice headphones, but I want to know if there is a proprietary CMS that is willing to pay to replace the outdoor condenser thing for my A/C within the next 12 months or not before making my decision.</p>&mdash; Josh Pollock (@Josh412) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Josh412/status/1379470244968857600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequent advertisements in this new &ldquo;You Deserve Better&rdquo; campaign are markedly more negative than the <a href=\"https://www.secret-update.com/from-wp\">launch video</a> sent to recipients of the headphones, packed with tasteless and tired motifs. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix representative Maya Gril said the campaign is part of the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;initiative to connect with an audience that doesn&rsquo;t think or know that Wix applies to their needs.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked what message they are intending to send with the videos, Gril likened using WordPress to being stuck in a bad relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The campaign shows in a clever way that WordPress users don&rsquo;t need to be stuck in a bad relationship with their platform and they should consider the alternative which allows them to focus on their actual work,&rdquo; Gril said. &ldquo;Each video in the campaign revolves around user pain points, which also highlight Wix&rsquo;s strengths.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen, who received a pair of the headphones, characterized the campaign as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1379513577619394563\">nuclear troll-marketing</a>.&rdquo; Instead of emphasizing any new, innovative features of the Wix platform, the ads come across as short, petulant narratives with no clear objective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re trying to provoke us into responding?&rdquo; WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1379217014472896512\">tweeted</a> in response to discussion on the campaign. &ldquo;I agree it comes off as creepy and misleading to impersonate &lsquo;WordPress&rsquo; this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell if trying to get a cease and desist letter is part of their strategy to try and drum up press. Unethical, tacky behavior from an unethical, tacky company. Good reminder: I really appreciate the integrity, principles, and ethics of WordPress ecosystem companies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix&rsquo;s new video ads seem more geared at professional developers with references that are likely outside of regular users&rsquo; experience with the software. The company may have failed to attract professionals in the past, which might explain why it opted to send thousands of dollars worth of headphones to influential WordPress users who fall within that demographic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Wix began shifting its marketing budget away from TV advertisements and added products that targeted agencies, developers, and designers. The company spent $55 million in marketing in the first quarter of 2019, according to reports shared with <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/wix-com-using-linkedin-target-designers-engineers-agencies/\">Digiday</a>. Wix became more active on LinkedIn&nbsp;and Twitter in pursuit of professionals who would bring more customers to its platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We want to make it clear that we have everything a professional needs,&rdquo; Maya Gril said. &ldquo;Our product is mature and constantly evolving. We&rsquo;re broadening our target audience and we want all new, existing and prospective users to know that Wix is the ultimate web creation platform to help them create, manage and grow online.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Wix is lacking one very important feature for catering to &ldquo;professional needs&rdquo; &ndash; data portability.  When asked for his thoughts on the campaign, Mullenweg added that Wix is the only CMS in the world that doesn&rsquo;t allow export &ndash; even Facebook does. The <a href=\"https://support.wix.com/en/article/exporting-or-embedding-your-wix-site-elsewhere\">Wix support center</a> states: Y<em>our Wix site and all of its content is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-site-hosting\">hosted</a>&nbsp;exclusively on Wix&rsquo;s servers, and cannot be exported elsewhere.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having content that is locked in and cannot be easily exported to other platforms or hosts does not appeal to professionals. No amount of extravagant spending on marketing stunts will convince developers to bring their customers to a proprietary CMS that also locks in your content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why their marketing doesn&rsquo;t appeal to the group of people who received the headphones. Many of them build WordPress as long-time contributors or run WordPress product businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wix fundamentally misunderstands why people use WordPress and what makes them stay. It&rsquo;s for reasons not found in their overly simplified list of differentiators played out in the new video ads. The desperate marketing tactics, which are geared more towards developers and power users, serve only to reinforce the platform&rsquo;s underdog status and lack of market awareness.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 07:10:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Twentig Now Upgrades the Twenty Twenty-One Theme Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114785\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:183:\"https://wptavern.com/twentig-now-upgrades-the-twenty-twenty-one-theme-experience?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=twentig-now-upgrades-the-twenty-twenty-one-theme-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6098:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Twentig, the brainchild of sibling co-founders Diane and Yann Collet, now supports the Twenty Twenty-One theme. The developers originally built the plugin, which is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/twentig/\">hosted on WordPress.org</a>, around the idea of &ldquo;supercharging&rdquo; Twenty Twenty. After its initial success, they have turned their sights onto the most recent default theme, adding a slew of new features over the past few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin still supports Twenty Twenty. It has merely added features for the latest default theme to its repertoire. The duo behind the plugin does not plan to stop there either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll definitively continue this with the future default themes,&rdquo; said Yann Collet. &ldquo;It will be exciting to see what we can do with Full Site Editing and the next block-based theme. With FSE coming, the opportunity is immense, making us confident that we can help people building better websites.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/supercharge-the-default-wordpress-theme-with-twentig-a-toolbox-for-twenty-twenty\">last covered it</a>, Twentig had a mere 4,000 active installations. All 34 of its reviews were five stars. Today, the plugin has accumulated over 10,000 installs and 75 five-star reviews. It did garner its first four-star rating, bringing the average down a tad. Nevertheless, its user base clearly loves what the plugin developers are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has created 10 <a href=\"https://twentig.com/demos/\">website demos</a> and 8 single-page examples for inspiration, each on top of the Twenty Twenty-One theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Orlando</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Kyoto</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Letuce</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great things about the plugin is that it essentially treats the default themes as a bit of a foundation, a framework. Users do not have to search around for a new theme when they tire of their current look. They can simply mix things up with Twentig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The goal is to showcase the power and flexibility of Twentig, the default theme, and the block editor,&rdquo; said the team. &ldquo;And ultimately inspire people to be creative with blocks. It&rsquo;s incredibly fun and fast to build directly inside the block editor with our block patterns instead of using a prototyping tool like Figma.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Extending the Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Twentig plugin&rsquo;s strength is in how it extends the block editor. Users are first presented with a custom sidebar panel with a plethora of patterns and full-page layouts. The plugin then further provides options for individual blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many other block-related plugins, Twentig does not register its own blocks. It uses the core WordPress blocks, except for Contact Form 7 integration, by mixing and matching them in various ways. If a user needs a call-to-action section, the plugin offers 11 patterns. If a user wants to spruce up their galleries, they have plenty of choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a single page layout.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s page layouts and patterns all work with both the Twenty Twenty and Twenty Twenty-One themes. Since Twentig relies primarily on core blocks, it is just a matter of making sure its custom CSS works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some blocks get an extra setting or two through the plugin. However, the bulk of customization options happen through the Twentig &ldquo;CSS Library.&rdquo; This is a setting under the Advanced tab for most blocks that users can access by clicking the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon next to the Additional CSS Classes option. It allows users to tick off checkboxes for numerous classes &mdash; each has an explanation of what it does. These are merely a set of utilities that change the block&rsquo;s output in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Picking Heading block classes via the Twentig CSS Library.\n\n\n\n<p>Twentig&rsquo;s CSS classes system follows the road paved by utility class frameworks like Tailwind. WordPress does a little of this but does not take a holistic approach to it. I have argued that WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/themes-of-the-future-a-design-framework-and-a-master-theme\">should build a design framework</a> in the past. A standardized class system would play well with block options, giving the development team a foundation for creating a better user experience across themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback is that the two extra stylesheets on top of Twenty Twenty-One&rsquo;s CSS add a bit of heft to the page. This could give pause to users who want to keep things lightweight. However, it has a smaller footprint than when using it with the older Twenty Twenty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Customizer Options and More</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing Twenty Twenty-One&rsquo;s design.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The plugin packages dozens of settings under the &ldquo;Twentig Options&rdquo; customizer panel. It also extends other sections, such as adding more color options. Users who care more about modifying the overall design than blocks will find nearly anything they need to put their own spin on their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything from fonts to site layouts to what post metadata to show is covered. Users can also switch between stacked and grid-style blog posts designs while further customizing based on their choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest downside to the plugin&rsquo;s customizer integration is that it does not utilize the live preview functionality with most of its options. Making a change means a frame refresh to see its effects. A little bit of custom JavaScript and a few partials for server-side changes would go a long way toward making the experience better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, future versions of Twentig will rely less on or not at all on the customizer. If Twenty Twenty-Two is a block-based, FSE theme, such customization will happen in the upcoming site editor.

WordPress contributor Aaron Campbell found it off-putting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The video takes some odd snipes at WordPress, but the whole overall feel is a bit shady/dirty. Not a great look for Wix in my opinion,&rdquo; Campbell said after receiving the headphones in the mail. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d be fine with it if it weren&rsquo;t signed as &lsquo;From WP&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yours, WP.&rsquo; By the time I got to watching the video I already had that bad taste in my mouth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some speculated that it may be the first act in a strange marketing saga of Wix targeting WordPress. Others were inadvertently convinced the headphones were actually from WordPress, since the advertisement uses WordPress&rsquo; trademark in the video. This may be a violation of the WordPress Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">trademark policy</a>, but this has not yet been confirmed.

In 2016, Matt Mullenweg&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wptavern.com/mullenweg-takes-aim-at-wix-over-gpl-abuses-wix-response-fails-to-address-licensing-issue\" target=\"_blank\">called out Wix for copying GPL code</a>&nbsp;from the WordPress mobile app and distributing it in its&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wixcom-launches-wix-app-providing-a-powerful-mobile-operating-system-for-small-business-owners-store-owners-hoteliers-and-bloggers-around-the-world-300339448.html\" target=\"_blank\">proprietary app</a>.&nbsp;This rendered the entire app in violation of the GPL. Instead of complying with the GPL, Wix responded by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wix-removes-gpl-licensed-wordpress-code-from-mobile-app-forks-original-mit-library\">removing the GPL-licensed code</a> and forking the original MIT-licensed library that the WordPress mobile app code was built upon. The fork was relicensed under an absurd modification of the MIT that prohibits the code&rsquo;s redistribution under any copyleft license. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2020, Wix passed Drupal as 4th <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management\">most popular CMS</a>, according to W3Techs. Since that time, Squarespace has grown to overtake Wix, pushing the CMS back into 5th place with 2.4% of the market. It&rsquo;s only natural that Wix would want to target WordPress, the market leader at 40.9%. However, the strategy of misrepresenting WordPress, while sending headphones to influential users and contributors, was perplexing and unsavory. Wix has not yet responded to my request for comment on its new marketing campaign.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 06:09:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: The Michelle WordPress Theme Launches With Dozens of Block Patterns and Styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114708\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:221:\"https://wptavern.com/the-michelle-wordpress-theme-launches-with-dozens-of-block-patterns-and-styles?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-michelle-wordpress-theme-launches-with-dozens-of-block-patterns-and-styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6534:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Oliver Juhas recently released his sixth theme to the WordPress community for free. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/michelle/\">Michelle</a> is a block-ready theme. However, it also supports Beaver Builder, Elementor, and other page-building plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a multipurpose theme, which is often an immediate turn-off for me. I prefer to see a purpose-driven design with a unique take on a niche. However, it is hard not to love the personality of Michelle. Juhas did not shy away from putting his brand of styling on the project, which is evident in his past <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/webmandesign/\">free themes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juhas is marketing Michelle as an accessibility-ready theme. However, it has yet to receive an accessibility review for the theme directory, which would allow it to be tagged as such. From a quick scan for common issues, everything seems to be in order. It will likely pass its review like some of his past free themes. And, &ldquo;inclusive, disabilities friendly, and barrierless&rdquo; are at the forefront of his branding for <a href=\"https://www.webmandesign.eu/\">WebMan Design</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As has become common for block-ready themes, Michelle packages a &ldquo;Content Only&rdquo; template. This is a post/page template that allows end-users to use the block editor as a page builder by not displaying anything other than the post content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme is yet another showcase of what is possible with the block editor. A couple of weeks after Anders Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/eksell-portfolio-theme-now-available-in-wordpress-themes-directory\">Eksell landed in the directory</a>, Juhas has presented the community with another quality theme. The two are entirely different in style and approach, but they both make the block system shine in their own ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Portfolio designed using multiple blocks.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can read more about the theme and peruse several demos via the <a href=\"https://www.webmandesign.eu/portfolio/michelle-wordpress-theme/\">theme&rsquo;s official page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Patterns and Styles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Michelle may be the only free theme in existence with 67 patterns. And, no, you did not misread that. It literally registers 67 block patterns. Yeah, that is a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a little bit of everything. From team galleries to logos, from hero headers to contact cards, it is hard not to find something you need. There was no way that I could realistically test all of them. However, for the dozen or so that I did try, they worked well and offered an easy one-click option for end-users.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Variable gallery with description pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>I always knew the day would come when a theme author would push the limits on the number of patterns it should offer. While 67 seems a bit excessive, I know from experience that we will see a day when patterns number in the 100s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate to continue beating a dead horse, but WordPress needs to use an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposal-to-create-an-expanded-view-or-overlay-for-the-block-patterns-inserter\">overlay system for block patterns</a>, at least for desktop users. Michelle makes it more apparent than ever that a small slide-out panel will not cut it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the theme&rsquo;s array of patterns is not enough to whet users&rsquo; appetites, its two dozen block styles just might.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Hiding a Heading block for everyone but screen-readers.\n\n\n\n<p>The options range from light and dark text shadows to variable galleries. It even has an &ldquo;accessibly hidden&rdquo; style for Heading blocks, which hides the text from the screen but makes it available to screen readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block-Ready Footer and 404 Page</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The theme allows end-users to build their footer and 404 error pages via the block system. Considering that the site editor is not available yet and the block editor is limited to post content, Juhas had to think outside the box a little to make this possible. He made use of the reusable blocks system. This is the sort of ingenuity that happens when theme authors are not burdened by too many rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the customizer, users can select the Theme Options &gt; Content section. From there, they are directed to pick a reusable block for their footer and 404 pages. Or they can simply opt out of it. The customizer section also links to the semi-secret admin page to create reusable blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Select reusable blocks for the 404 and footer content.\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, I have used a similar technique for 404 views. Instead of going the reusable block route, theme users could select a private page. Either option is acceptable for allowing users to modify content they may not have been able to customize in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Starter Content</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Michelle makes extensive use of the WordPress starter content feature. This allows new WordPress users to see what their site could look like with pre-loaded content. The theme creates Home, About, Blog, Services, FAQ, and Contact pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Homepage starter content.\n\n\n\n<p>The feature has languished in recent years. Many theme authors had hoped they would eventually be able to use the feature for non-new installs too. However, Helen Hou-Sand&iacute; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-combine-its-long-neglected-theme-previewer-with-starter-content\">got the ball rolling again in November 2020</a>, breathing new life into an old idea. WordPress.org would begin displaying theme starter content via the theme preview system. Only the Twenty Twenty-One, Twenty Twenty, and Twenty Seventeen themes received this treatment last year. It now seems that it is being rolled out for others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a welcome change in the directory. Users can now <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/michelle/\">get a feel of the Michelle theme</a> without tracking down the author&rsquo;s demo. It is a better experience than the old-school demo content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue is that the previewer uses the first sentence of the theme description for the demo&rsquo;s tagline. This can make for a long and unusual bit of text. It can also mess up a theme&rsquo;s layout as it is doing with Michelle. I hope this will be addressed from WordPress&rsquo;s end soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other theme authors should note that starter content could factor into whether a user skips over or downloads their theme.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 23:21:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Doctorow on IP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=53979\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2021/04/doctorow-on-ip/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:655:\"<p>It&#8217;s not every day you see noted writer Cory Doctorow refer to a column as &#8220;the piece I&#8217;m most proud of,&#8221; and <a href=\"https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/\">his essay in Locus Magazine on IP doesn&#8217;t disappoint</a>, connecting the free software movement and the evolution of the term &#8220;author&#8217;s monopolies&#8221; to &#8220;intellectual property.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The essay on DRM and Apple, <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/22/gandersauce/#petard\">available on his WP-powered blog</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1374020143316004864\">or Twitter</a>, is also worth reading.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 02:42:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: March 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10084\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9799:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This way of iterating improves WordPress and ties back to one of my favorite open-source principles.

The GPL author and founder of the FSF announced last week that he had rejoined the board and is not planning to resign a second time. An <a href=\"https://rms-open-letter.github.io/\">open letter</a> signed by more than 3,000 people called&nbsp;for the removal of Stallman from all leadership positions, including the GNU project, and removal of the entire Board of the FSF. So far it has gained support from Red hat, Mozilla, Outreachy, the Software Conservancy project, and many other high profile organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are long past the point where we can pretend that the most important thing about software freedom is the software,&rdquo; Mozilla Engineering Community Manager Michael Hoye said in signing support for the open letter. &ldquo;We cannot demand better from the internet if we do not demand better from our leaders, our colleagues and ourselves.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the resignation of former FSF board member Kat Walsh, the organization&rsquo;s executive director, deputy director, and chief technology officer have also resigned. They published a joint <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/executive-director/management-team-members-resigning\">statement</a>, reaffirming their commitment to the mission of free software, despite their departure:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p></p><p>As members of FSF management, we have decided to resign, with specific end dates to be determined. We believe in the importance of the FSF&rsquo;s mission and feel a new team will be better placed to implement recent changes in governance. Free software and copyleft are critical issues of our time, and the FSF is, and should continue to be, the organization leading this movement. FSF staff have our utmost respect, support, and appreciation, and it has been a privilege to work with you all. Our team&rsquo;s mutual goal is to ensure a smooth transition while supporting the necessary renovation of the foundation&rsquo;s governance.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>An oddly-timed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fsf/status/1376714994721689601\">tweet</a> announced a new published statement the FSF board voted on, which &ldquo;condemns misogyny, racism, and other bigotry as well as defamation, intimidation, and unfair attacks on free thought and speech.&rdquo; The statement was met with ridicule and outrage on Twitter, as it hints at the defense Stallman used when he <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gpl-author-richard-stallman-resigns-from-free-software-foundation\">resigned as the FSF board director</a>, claiming he had been subject to &ldquo;a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While our primary mission is freedom for software users, we want to be clear, the FSF board unanimously condemns misogyny, racism,and other bigotry as well as defamation, intimidation, and unfair attacks on free thought and speech.</p>&mdash; Free Software Fndn. (@fsf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fsf/status/1376714994721689601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent statements published to the FSF website indicate that its leadership is doubling down on the decision to reinstate Stallman:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><a href=\"https://fsf.org/about/staff-and-board\">Some of our colleagues in the FSF</a>&nbsp;have decided to resign. We are grateful for the good work they have done for so long, and we will miss them. We regret losing them; we regret the situation that has motivated them to leave.</p><p>We appreciate their strong commitment to free software and we want to find replacements with a similar competence and commitment. We are open to suggestions and applications for these positions.</p><p>Finally, we would like to thank the numerous friends across the free software movement who have recently joined as well as those who have left and provided suggestions for helping us through this difficult time.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The FSF seems to be counting the resignations as an acceptable loss, as funds from donors are evaporating. Several organizations have discontinued financial support for the organization. Most notably, Red Hat, a long-time donor with hundreds of contributors who have submitted millions of lines of code to projects stewarded by the FSF, publicly <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-statement-about-richard-stallmans-return-free-software-foundation-board\">discontinued support</a> for the organization and any of its events. In addition to $708,016 in membership dues, the FSF received $1,383,003 in contributions, gifts, and grants, which makes up the bulk of its annual revenue, according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8557#accountability-transparency-performance-metrics\">report</a> on Charity Navigator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman is synonymous with the FSF and his reinstatement puts many free software advocates in a difficult position. Some cannot easily write off the entire organization, as it is engaged in important work. The FSF publishes the GPL, LGPL, and FDL licenses. It also holds copyrights to defend free software from those who would seek to make it proprietary and has the power to enforce the GPL. As part of its <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/licensing\">Free Software Licensing and Compliance Lab</a>, the organization works to ensure that free software distributors respect their obligations to pass on the user freedoms that these licenses are meant to convey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fedora Council cited the FSF&rsquo;s important function when publishing a <a href=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-council-statement-on-richard-stallman-rejoining-fsf-board/\">statement</a> on why it is pulling funding from the organization:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Along with many in the free and open source software world, the Fedora Council was taken aback that the Free Software Foundation (FSF) has allowed Richard Stallman to rejoin their Board of Directors given his history of abuse and harassment. The Fedora Council does not normally involve itself with the governance of other projects. However, this is an exceptional case due to the FSF&rsquo;s stewardship of the GPL family of licenses, which are critical for the work we do.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The council will not provide funding or attend any FSF-sponsored events where Stallman is a featured speaker or exhibitor, and stated that this also applies to any organization where he has a leadership role.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Responds to Stallman&rsquo;s Reinstatement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until today, WordPress had not published an official statement on Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement to the FSF board. <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/\">The WordPress Foundation</a> website lists the Free Software Foundation as one of the project&rsquo;s inspirations. WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg was also among the FSF&rsquo;s list of patrons in previous years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After asking WordPress&rsquo; executive director Josepha Haden Chomphosy for a comment regarding the matter, she published a <a href=\"https://josepha.blog/2021/04/02/on-recent-news-about-the-fsf-board-of-directors/\">statement</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In short, I do not support his return as a board member.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes me proud that the WordPress project embodies the best traditions of open source and retires outdated traditions, or shibboleths, that do not have a place in our mission: to democratize publishing and grow the open web. For years, this community has been committed to championing underrepresented voices and maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for those we rarely see in open source.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the statement is published on her personal blog, Haden Chomphosy confirmed that this is the WordPress project&rsquo;s official stance on Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement. The statement quietly calls out Stallman&rsquo;s lack of accountability and the fact that he has not publicly acknowledged how harmful his behavior has been to the free software community:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The high standards for welcoming behavior are held across the board. WordPress contributors lead with accountability, acknowledgment of error, and a genuine desire to grow based on feedback. Under the guidance of many thoughtful leaders, WordPress makes space for those who are committed to growth.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The message is more focused on the positive aspects of the WordPress community and its values but is clear in the first paragraph: WordPress does not support Stallman&rsquo;s return as an FSF board member.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 18:57:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Disable the WordPress Block Editor’s Fullscreen Mode With a Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114659\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:195:\"https://wptavern.com/disable-the-wordpress-block-editors-fullscreen-mode-with-a-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=disable-the-wordpress-block-editors-fullscreen-mode-with-a-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3173:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Wednesday, Johan Jonk Stenstr&ouml;m released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fullscreen-mode-b-gone/\">Fullscreen Mode B Gone</a> to the WordPress plugin directory. As the catchy title implies, it gets rid of the block editor&rsquo;s fullscreen mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As anyone who prefers to opt-out of fullscreen mode knows, there are moments when you log into WordPress and hop over to the post editor only to find it is not in the state you last left it. It is a slight annoyance but enough to dampen the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly two years ago, Andrew Duthie opened a ticket for storing <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15105\">users&rsquo; editor preferences to the database</a> instead of their browser&rsquo;s local storage. This includes basic settings like toggling whether fullscreen mode should be enabled. Local storage is not considered sticky, at least not permanently. It can be cleared in a variety of ways. This means that users must deal with disabling the default fullscreen editor more often than they should. It is also not stored when switching browsers, using private tabs, or when working on multiple sites across the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal should be to persistently save preferences on a per-user basis. There has been little movement on that ticket in the past year. Most comments have come in the form of closed duplicates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, users must look for alternative solutions. That&rsquo;s where plugins like Fullscreen Mode B Gone offer some assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is simple. It toggles the block editor&rsquo;s fullscreen mode off. Regardless of whether users have switched browsers, cleared their local storage, or anything else, they can safely enter the editor without being bombarded by a different editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />New post with fullscreen mode disabled.\n\n\n\n<p>Both an upside and a downside of the plugin is that it resets fullscreen mode each time the user opens the editor. It does not address the sticky issue. For users like me who prefer to always have fullscreen mode disabled or only turn it on once in a while, this is ideal. However, for users who want WordPress to remember the last state, it is best to skip this plugin. The default experience is better suited to what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I dislike about how the editor works is that it requires JavaScript for plugins to make changes like this. Even if it is merely a few lines of code, it still calls for one more HTTP response just to alter a default setting. At least with PHP, a simple filter would have sufficed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not Stenstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s first editor-related plugin.

Users can now define a default Image block size. The development team also continued work on normalizing block toolbars, created a &ldquo;theme&rdquo; block category, and added a padding option to the Verse block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors fixed over 30 bugs. However, the bulk of work went toward Full Site Editing (FSE) with over 70 commits. It is an impressive effort toward the looming WordPress 5.8 deadline and an upcoming decision on whether FSE will land in the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team included a few additional blocks for FSE. The new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29766\">Login/out block</a> displays a login or logout link, depending on whether the user is logged out or in, respectively. The block also has an option for displaying a login form. A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29428\">Query Title block</a> was included with an Archive Title variation, which will automatically output the current title on archive views. The team also added a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29613\">Term Description block</a> for displaying category, tag, and custom taxonomy term descriptions on archives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, as has become ritual at this point, I am now writing in an editor that looks different than it did a day ago. In version 10.2, all of our Paragraph blocks were shifted to the left.  In 10.3, none of our theme&rsquo;s width constraints are applying to the content canvas.   I still optimistically envision a day in which a Gutenberg update does not affect theme styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Default Image Sizes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the features I have been patiently awaiting has finally arrived &mdash; <em>sort of.</em> We all have pet-peeves when it comes to the block editor, and not being able to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29966\">set the default image size</a> when using the Image block has been high on my list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recently-added feature uses the core WordPress <code>image_default_size</code> option to handle this. When set, any new Image blocks added will default to this chosen size. While it is a welcome enhancement, there are two problems with the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first issue is that this option is not exposed in the WordPress admin interface. That is unless you know how to get to the secret <code>/wp-admin/options.php</code> page. There are no links to it, but users can directly enter the URL, scroll down to find the <code>image_default_size</code> option, and manually type in the size handle (e.g., <code>full</code>, <code>large</code>, etc.) that they want before saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second issue is that it solves the problem on a site-wide level but not on a user level. For publications like WP Tavern with multiple authors, we all have our own preferred workflows. For me, I like to pre-crop all of my images before uploading, which often means that I want to use the full-sized image in the post. However, other writers may want to go a different route. The default image size should be a user preference, falling back to the site setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I am happy to see some progress. I can skip that extra step of setting the image size every time I add an image to a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let&rsquo;s make this happen for image alignment. Or, how about we let users set defaults for many more block options to help them streamline their workflows?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Normalizing Block Toolbar Groupings</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Semantic groupings for the Paragraph block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Building off <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-1-enhances-reusable-blocks-updates-social-icons-spacing-options-and-normalizes-image-block-toolbar\">work that started in version 10.1</a>, the development team continued <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/25983\">normalizing the block toolbar</a>. Over a dozen blocks received the new treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end goal is to create semantic groupings of the toolbar buttons for all blocks. This will make it easier for end-users to find options and for developers to know where to place buttons in the future. The order in the toolbar, broken down into four groups, is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Meta</li><li>Block Level</li><li>Inline Level</li><li>More Options</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The toolbar separates each grouping with a border. With the Paragraph block, for example, the text alignment option is on the block level. However, the bold, italic, and link settings are inline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers creating custom blocks should follow the best practices under the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/docs/how-to-guides/designers/block-design.md\">block design documentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme Block Category</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme category with Template Part, Header, and Footer blocks.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When using a block-based theme, which enables FSE mode, Gutenberg 10.3 introduces a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/30020\">&ldquo;Theme&rdquo; category in the inserter</a>. It currently includes the Template Part, Header, and Footer blocks. The goal for the enhancement is to indicate that they are the building blocks of themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enhancement could be better if the category was not so tough to find in the inserter&rsquo;s long list of blocks. I am still arguing that we bring back the original accordion in the UI. In the site editor, it would be better to shift the Theme category to the top, which is primarily for editing theme-related things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Padding Option for the Verse Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding horizontal padding to the Verse block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users can now set the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29820\">padding for the Verse block</a>. The setting feels a bit out of place right now without any other stylistic options. Background and border options will make padding more relevant in the long term. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, it is nice to see more blocks getting spacing options. It just happened to land on what, I&rsquo;d wager, is the least-used block for WordPress users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 22:21:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: FSE Outreach Round #4: Building a Restaurant-Themed Header With Gutenberg’s Site Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114578\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:233:\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header-with-gutenbergs-site-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fse-outreach-round-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header-with-gutenbergs-site-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6069:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\">announced the fourth round of testing</a> for the Full Site Editing (FSE) Outreach program last week. This testing phase calls for users to build a restaurant-themed header via the Gutenberg plugin&rsquo;s site editor. Testing is open to anyone, and participants should leave feedback by April 8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The testing process is broken down into 24 steps with both setup and testing instructions. Those participating will need to activate the latest version of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks</a> theme and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg\">Gutenberg</a> plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more people who leave feedback, the better it is for the project. The program provides that direct link between the user and the developer team that has often been missing in the past. If you have an hour or so of spare time, jump right in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a Custom Header</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I want to push the site editor beyond its limits, creating move advanced layouts. However, the site builder is so fundamentally limiting &mdash; and broken in some cases &mdash; that it is easy to become frustrated. And, depending on which version of Gutenberg you are using, such as the latest dev vs. stable version, you can get wildly different results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This propensity to jump ahead of the lesson is something I have done my entire life. In school, I frustrated more than a few teachers. I would be working on stuff from the end of the chapter when they were still explaining the basics to the rest of the class a half-hour later. I have always wanted to get to the &ldquo;good stuff.&rdquo; Of course, I did so by blazing past the boring fundamentals. I also dropped out of software engineering twice in college because building calculators was neither exciting nor challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like always, I jumped ahead with Round #4 of the FSE Outreach Program. I came to the realization that attempting to do anything remotely advanced with the site editor was simply not going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want Full Site Editing to be successful, but we are mere weeks away from the deadline that determines whether it will land in the next version of WordPress. Somehow this experience felt like a step back from where the plugin was a few weeks ago as I built a custom homepage as part of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-2-building-a-custom-homepage-with-gutenbergs-site-editor\">second round</a> of the FSE Outreach testing program. I do not know whether the problems stemmed directly from Gutenberg, the TT1 Blocks theme, or both. As someone who prides himself on near-infinite patience, Round #4 sought to crack me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to recreate several elements from the UK-based <a href=\"https://www.phocafe.co.uk/\">Pho Cafe</a> page header. I knew the site editor could not yet manage a one-to-one replication.  I still thought I could pull in parts of it but utterly failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Pho Cafe website page header.\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciate the need for controlled circumstances. Step-by-step testing puts everyone on the same page, makes it easier to gather data, and allows others to reproduce issues. I am just bad at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Following the Rules</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I restarted from scratch. I followed the rules. And, for the most part, the testing round was successful. I built a restaurant website header from the instructions and put my own spin on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom beachside caf&eacute; header design.\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I hit a few snags. That is what the testing program is all about &mdash; identifying pain points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most problematic issue is that what I saw in the editor was not what I got on the front end. I have played around with it enough to know in my mind what it <em>might</em> look like on the front end to make adjustments without previewing the changes. However, that is not the user experience that WordPress is shooting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Editor view of the restaurant website header.\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, on the front end, I tidied up the padding for the Group block and bottom margin for the Columns block for the &ldquo;Order Online&rdquo; strip across the top of the header. I thought about making the button smaller too. However, I stuck with the TT1 Blocks theme default. Ultimately, padding, margin, and other types of sizing/spacing should be customizable by the end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wide and full block alignments completely disappeared after activating TT1 Blocks. I am unsure if this was a recent change in the Gutenberg plugin or the theme. Nevertheless, they were gone, which was one reason I had trouble recreating pieces of the original page header I wanted to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TT1 Blocks theme also has a hardcoded font-size for the site title link. This means that users cannot change the size of the Site Title block. I wanted to bump this up a little to make it more prominent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the first design I was shooting for, I wanted my Navigation items to look like individual buttons, each with a bit of whitespace in between. However, the Navigation block does not currently support adding backgrounds to each nav item. Even if it did, it also does not have a horizontal margin setting to add the spacing. And, I outright refuse to use a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-2-adds-spacers-to-navigation-lists-lets-users-categorize-template-parts-and-introduces-scoped-patterns\">Spacer block between items</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to spruce my restaurant page header up a bit with a custom background. To do that, I added the primary elements inside a Cover block. Currently, the only way to do that is to copy all of the blocks, delete the old ones, and paste them into a new Cover block. A welcome enhancement to the editor would be an option for &ldquo;grouping&rdquo; blocks into a Cover like what is possible with the Group block.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 22:07:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: First Look at Initial Designs for WordPress’ Block Pattern Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-initial-designs-for-wordpress-block-pattern-directory?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=first-look-at-initial-designs-for-wordpress-block-pattern-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3268:\"<p>WordPress contributors began <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-discuss-launching-an-official-block-pattern-directory\">discussing</a> the possibility of a block pattern directory in October 2020, an idea that garnered enthusiastic support. The directory would offer a place to browse user-submitted patterns, as well as one-click installation of patterns from the block inserter inside the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interface designer Shaun Andrews <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/03/30/wordpress-org-patterns-directory/\">published</a> the initial designs for the pattern directory yesterday. Patterns will be displayed in a masonry-style grid that can be sorted by category, which works well for pattern thumbnails of varying heights. Users can search the directory and sort by featured, newest, and most popular. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cK4jSz1Fx9c\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/HiaWY_zXIf.gif\" alt=\"Masonry grid\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that a user will be able to copy a single pattern to their clipboard while visiting the directory and paste it directly into the block editor. Users will also be able to &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; patterns from the directory and access them inside the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/czovcau6B_D\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/OYhRf1SQz9.gif\" alt=\"Copy pattern flow\" width=\"1024\" height=\"757\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the plan is that anyone will be able to create and submit a pattern without having a lot of technical knowledge. Andrews shared a quick landing page mockup to explain what patterns are and how to submit one. Prospective pattern authors would be able to create a pattern on WordPress.org using a hosted instance of the block editor with a few tweaks specific to describing and categorizing the pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who submit patterns will have a new &ldquo;My Patterns&rdquo; screen listing all of their patterns, ones they have favorited, information about how many people have favorited their submitted patterns, and status updates for patterns still in review.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a big opportunity for designers to contribute to the overall WordPress ecosystem without having to know how to code a&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;or a theme,&rdquo; Andrews said. It opens up a new avenue of design contribution that would not have been possible with the same scale of distribution in the days of the previous editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still many unanswered questions, such as how &ldquo;featured&rdquo; patterns would be chosen, how drafts work, if the patterns can only include core blocks, how users will browse and manage favorite patterns in the editor, who approves the patterns, how pattern authors can edit existing patterns, and more. If you want to help out on the project, check out the Pattern Directory repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory\">GitHub</a>.

The experience was geared toward website designers and developers, providing them with a central location to manage their client projects. More than simply a new set of tools, the company created a dedicated branding experience for GoDaddy Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are committed to, passionate about, and truly in awe of web designers and developers,&rdquo; said Adam Warner, the Global Field Marketing Sr. Manager at GoDaddy. &ldquo;It has been a pleasure supporting this audience, but it&rsquo;s now our mission to up the ante and deepen our commitment. Our goal with GoDaddy Pro is to empower web pros with a unified tool that helps them create outsize efficiency for their operation, deliver incredible results for their clients, grow their skills and operation, and connect and inspire by fostering community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Expand 2021 event is a continuation of that goal. The target audience is described as &ldquo;web designers and developers who identify as eager side hustlers or website freelancers.&rdquo; The conference&rsquo;s sessions are meant to provide instructions, resources, and connections to help developers grow their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will begin with an opening keynote from GoDaddy&rsquo;s Aman Bhutani, the CEO; Tara Wellington, the Senior Director of Product Management; and Warner. It will feature eight sessions, split evenly between each day. The event&rsquo;s schedule will fit into a small window between 10 am and 12:30 pm <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/pt\">Pacific Time</a> on both days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By some conference standards, even virtual ones, this may seem like a small event. However, the tighter focus could be a welcome one for people suffering from <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2020-canceled-due-to-pandemic-stress-and-online-event-fatigue\">online event fatigue</a>. Each session is scheduled to last around 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sessions will focus on a wide span of topics like client management, eCommerce, creating a project starter stack, website security, and scaling a freelance business with care plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The History Behind GoDaddy Pro Expand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Spearheading the first Expand conference, Warner avoided talking about target audiences, performance indicators, or budgetary concerns in an internal memo sent throughout GoDaddy. The effort is about creating a series of GoDaddy Pro Expand events globally in the coming months and years that help the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea for a conference had been in the making since 2018. Warner described the purpose of GoDaddy Pro, Expand 2021, and meetups as empowering and inspiring the next generation of web designers and developers to deliver for their clients and create self-sustaining freelance businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Expand 2021 is, in some way, my Opus for giving back to the community that raised me and giving the new generation a head start in following their own passions. It&rsquo;s the culmination of my years exploring and creating on the internet. My first time on the internet was in 1993. I was in my third year of college, working at Hungry Howie&rsquo;s Pizza in small-town Michigan. A co-worker had some of us to her house, and her boyfriend logged us on to a Bulletin Board System (BBS). We chatted in a dull, orange text late into the night to people around the world.</p><p>I was amazed then, and that sense of wonder and possibility stayed with me as I started to learn HTML and build simple websites a few years later. Then came my discovery of WordPress in early 2005 and the incredible global community of users willing to lift each other up for collective success.</p><p>It was at that moment, I knew I had to find a way to make websites and WordPress my career.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, 28 years later, Warner is taking the next step in organizing his first event from scratch along with over 40 others. He wanted to build a conference that was devoid of &ldquo;talking heads touting theoretical advice.&rdquo; Instead, to offer an experience with actionable knowledge that web professionals can use immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The real purpose of Expand 2021 is to &lsquo;pay it forward&rsquo; by advising and inspiring the next generation of web designers and developers, enabling them to take the next steps in their paths,&rdquo; said Warner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 20:16:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: So you want to make block patterns?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=9995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/so-you-want-to-make-block-patterns/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12967:\"<img width=\"632\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Block-Patterns.jpg?resize=632%2C356&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9998\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever built something for the WordPress block editor — a theme or a plugin — you may have also heard about <strong>block patterns</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the patterns that come bundled with WordPress, I thought it would be nice to dedicate to them a short post. They&#8217;re pretty nice, useful shortcuts when you know them, but there&#8217;s a good chance you may not know what they are or why you might want to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s a block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are&nbsp;<strong>collections of pre-arranged blocks</strong>&nbsp;that can be combined and arranged in many ways making it easier to create beautiful content. They act as a head-start, leaving you to plug and play with your content as you see fit and be as simple as single blocks or as complex as a full-page layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-library.png?resize=632%2C414&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10021\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They live in a tab in the block library. You can click or drag and you&#8217;re able to preview them with your site&#8217;s styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/block-pattern.png?resize=632%2C413&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10022\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, a block pattern is just a bunch of blocks put together in advance:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>	&lt;!-- wp:group --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;\n&lt;!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":553,\"width\":150,\"height\":150,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"className\":\"is-style-rounded\"} --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://blockpatterndesigns.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/StockSnap_HQR8BJFZID-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-553\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;\n&lt;!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"center\",\"className\":\"is-style-large\"} --&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-large\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Contributing makes me feel like I\'m being useful to the planet.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— Anna Wong, &lt;em&gt;Volunteer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:quote --&gt;\n&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:group --&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s also how you create them: just use the block editor to configure a smattering of blocks to your liking, and the hard part&#8217;s over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I get them in the block library?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-patterns/\">more documentation in the handbook</a>, but what it boils down to is this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php \n/*\nPlugin Name: Quote Pattern Example Plugin\n*/\n\nregister_block_pattern(\n	\'my-plugin/my-quote-pattern\',\n	array(\n		\'title\'       =&gt; __( \'Quote with Avatar\', \'my-plugin\' ),\n		\'categories\'  =&gt; array( \'text\' ),\n		\'description\' =&gt; _x( \'A big quote with an avatar\".\', \'Block pattern description\', \'my-plugin\' ),\n		\'content\'     =&gt; \'&lt;!-- wp:group --&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":553,\"width\":150,\"height\":150,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"className\":\"is-style-rounded\"} --&gt;&lt;div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"&gt;&lt;figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://blockpatterndesigns.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/StockSnap_HQR8BJFZID-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-553\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"center\",\"className\":\"is-style-large\"} --&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-large\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Contributing makes me feel like I\\\'m being useful to the planet.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— Anna Wong, &lt;em&gt;Volunteer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:quote --&gt;&lt;!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --&gt;&lt;hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-default\"/&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /wp:group --&gt;\',\n	)\n);\n\n?&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f446.png\" alt=\"👆\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> That&#8217;s a snippet of PHP, which means you can drop it in a WordPress plugin, or perhaps more simply, paste it into the <strong>functions.php</strong> file from your theme. Done:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Quote.jpg?resize=632%2C430&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10047\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For patterns that include images, it&#8217;s worth thinking about where those are stored. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">TT1 Blocks theme</a> (which is a fancy name for &#8220;TwentyTwentyOne Blocks&#8221;) stores images in the theme library.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now what?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing about a block pattern is, as soon as you insert it from the block library, it stops being <em>a cohesive unit</em> — now it&#8217;s just a smattering of blocks, detached from the pattern you created and meant to be customized to your liking. It&#8217;s a <em>shortcut</em>, not a <em>template</em>. That also means you don&#8217;t have to worry about switching themes or deactivating pattern plugins: the blocks you already inserted won&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, if you like this one pattern so much you want to use it again and again, with no customization at all, you can make it into a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/02/gutenberg-tutorial-reusable-blocks/\">reusable block</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks are created, as the name implies, to be reused. The feature is a great way to store small bits of commonly used snippets that you can edit in one place to update in all. &#8220;<strong>Follow me on Twitter</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Article series</strong>,<strong>&#8220;</strong> or <strong>&#8220;Subscribe to my podcast&#8221;</strong> are great examples of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What makes a good block pattern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns, as they ship today, are limited by the features available. If the block editor doesn&#8217;t allow you to customize letter-spacing, your block pattern can&#8217;t either. While the Global Styles project will expand what&#8217;s to blocks, in the meantime, we have to work with the available tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even then, with the most basic ingredients — color, photography, typography — it is possible to do a lot:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W3RKCu5c7ONKnmuLdChmOhD40iZAFseq30i-qGwqFaq0dPTj_U5b1JXhhRR96-jRvJvKgC8BBZA4p_-EBYF-WoMRPoDLgCX8FG3RIWQhv6zX6-H7xBj4FZGGRm7cl_qdVgRy9G8q\" alt=\"\" />Three columns with images and text<br /></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Media-and-text-with-image-on-the-right-1.png?resize=632%2C397&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10036\" />Media and text with image on the right</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I designed these patterns to potentially land in WordPress core, which all have a few properties in common:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>They share a theme.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can think of a pattern as a section of a website: it is meant to be part of a whole, and so it works best when it can exist in the context of other patterns that share the same theme. There are a few sharing a Nature theme in the patterns above, a few sharing an Art theme, and others sharing an Architecture theme. When seen together, it becomes easier to see how you might be able to piece together multiple pages of your site, one page at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Large-header-with-text-and-a-button.png?resize=632%2C406&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10033\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Media-text-with-image-on-the-right.png?resize=632%2C405&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10034\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>They share a minimalist color palette.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By being parts of a whole, patterns will inevitably land in a context that uses different colors. With a reduced color palette, there&#8217;s both a better chance of fitting in and less to customize to make it just right.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Heading-and-a-paragraph.jpg?resize=632%2C535&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10042\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Media-text-in-a-full-height-container.jpg?resize=632%2C271&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10043\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The best patterns <strong>do things you might have not done otherwise</strong>.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether that&#8217;s images offset to create a unique silhouette, or just using less visible features (like fixed positioning in the Cover block), it&#8217;s a way to surface creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Tip: You can use any block in your patterns, including blocks that came from a plugin.

Any open source project can receive contributions from a Fund, even those that are not listed on Open Collective due to having their own foundation or working with another fiscal host. The new feature was added to Open Collective&rsquo;s existing non-profit funding platform that serves more than 2,500 projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funds were designed to mitigate the friction between corporations and open source projects, cutting out the excessive bureaucracy that can sometimes stifle funding for smaller projects. Companies can use the feature to support multiple projects that are crucial to their business efforts and underlying tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Funds facilitates a relationship between maintainers and organizations on their own terms,&rdquo; Open Collective co-founder Pia Mancini said. &ldquo;No contracts, no promises, no agendas. We take on the work of administrating payments to projects and of ensuring companies have what they need in their procurement processes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, if you wanted to work on an open source project full time, you would most likely need to be sponsored by a company. Although WordPress&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a>&rdquo; campaign isn&rsquo;t perfect, it has brought some stability, enabling the project to drive important efforts forward even in leaner times of contribution from unpaid volunteers. Some open source projects aren&rsquo;t able to thrive this way, especially those that are categorized as simple utilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical dependencies can sometimes be grossly underfunded when supported by only a handful of individuals who may not have steady employment to buoy their maintainership efforts. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://heartbleed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Heartbleed Bug</a> that was disclosed in 2014 put a spotlight on the immense economic challenges of funding open source work. In the aftermath of this global fiasco, the tech industry turned its attention towards brainstorming different initiatives that might create a more healthy ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open Collective&rsquo;s Funds feature aims to make &ldquo;working for an open source project a legitimate alternative to a career working for a for-profit corporation.&rdquo; Prior to launching the new feature, the platform quietly tested a number of Funds with Airbnb, Indeed, Salesforce, and other companies with successful outcomes for maintainers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Airbnb&rsquo;s investment in webpack has enabled groundbreaking advancements in web compiler technology, paved the way for the last 2 major versions, and enabled us to devote entire teams to ecosystem management, CLI, docs, and infrastructure,&rdquo; webpack core team member Sean Larkin said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Airbnb received so many reports of the positive impact of its Fund that the company decided to expand its open source sustainability commitment by 50% to $150,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Donations from Airbnb have made it possible for ESLint to pay core contributors for work,&rdquo; ESLint creator Nicholas Zakas said. &ldquo;As a result, contributors are able to spend more time pushing forward large projects that weren&rsquo;t possible when we relied solely on volunteering.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As open source projects are becoming less self-contained and more interdependent, maintaining the health of the overall ecosystem is a priority. When smaller utilities that everyone depends on are underfunded, it can have a ripple effect that slows down progress throughout the vast web of projects that rely on the dependency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open Collective&rsquo;s Funds feature is one solution that helps companies streamline their donations and keep track of their contributions to multiple projects in one place. Companies interested in creating a new Fund can get in touch with the organization via its <a href=\"https://www.oscollective.org/contact\">contact form</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 06:39:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Creating Tiled, Masonry, and Other Image Layouts With Meow Gallery\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114473\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/creating-tiled-masonry-and-other-image-layouts-with-meow-gallery?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=creating-tiled-masonry-and-other-image-layouts-with-meow-gallery\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4546:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I am uncertain of how I first came across the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/\">Meow Gallery</a> WordPress plugin. It was a pinned tab in my browser for a while, but it has recently become one of those projects that I keep coming back to. I delight in the imagery of the Meow Apps brand, created by Japan-based software developer Jordy Meow. It has the sort of fun and artistic visuals that are often missing in the WordPress business ecosystem. This creativity also comes across in the Meow Apps plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with WordPress gallery plugins is that I find a new one I want to use every other week. It is a bit of an obsession. There are so many different options that it is tough to grow comfortable with a solution before finding something new and shiny to tinker with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the case with Meow Gallery. From the simplicity of its options to the range of layouts that the plugin provides, it has found its way onto my ever-growing list of favorite gallery-related plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also prefer the decoupled, modular nature of what Meow Apps is doing with its plugins. Meow Gallery keeps a tight focus on the gallery layout itself.  Users can select an image lightbox/overlay extension separately. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-lightbox/\">Meow Lightbox</a> is recommended, of course. However, both are developed to work alongside third-party gallery or lightbox plugins. It is the sort of building-block solution that more developers in the community should embrace, ultimately offering end-users more freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meow Gallery is straightforward to use. It works similarly to the core Gallery block. When first adding images, users can drag-and-drop them directly into it or select from their media library. From that point, the experiences begin to diverge.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Tiled gallery with 10px gutter.\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of selecting the number of columns, whether to crop, or the image size, the Meow Gallery block automatically handles this based on the type of layout chosen.  Options may change based on the layout too. The following are available:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tiles</li><li>Masonry</li><li>Justified</li><li>Square</li><li>Cascade</li><li>Carousel (pro only)</li><li>Map (pro only)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The block also offers a handful of basic animations, link options, and more. However, the gutter setting provides more control over the output. The gutter is the horizontal and vertical space between images. Users can choose between 0 and 100. Gutter spacing is the one option from the plugin that WordPress should adopt, allowing theme authors to opt-into a default and users to customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Square-layout gallery with no gutter.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also has <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/plugin/meow-gallery/\">commercial features</a>, but they are value-added upsells instead of necessary functionality. The pro version includes extras like more layouts, new animations, and infinite scrolling for galleries with many images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one off-putting issue with Meow Gallery is that it creates a custom block. Having already seen solutions from other plugin authors that extend the default Gallery block, I was hoping this plugin would go in the same direction. Extending the core block makes it easier for end-users to switch gallery plugins at any point. However, users can transform Meow Gallery blocks into Gallery blocks and vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the WordPress Gallery block is also undergoing drastic changes. Currently, the plan is to make it more of a container block that houses nested Image blocks. By not extending the core block, plugin users will miss out on some of the advantages this change brings. Of course, the plugin developer could follow suit and add the same features to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meow Gallery relies on the WordPress <code>gallery</code> shortcode. Therefore, it will continue working regardless of whether users deactivate the plugin in the future. As a fallback, it is not a perfect solution. Users of the block editor would likely rather have it revert to the core Gallery block &mdash; the shortcode and block are not remotely the same. However, it is a bit of a compromise between showing a working gallery or nothing at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect the reliance on the shortcode is for historical reasons. Meow Gallery existed in the pre-block era. However, the developer has managed to keep up with the times, offering support for both the block and classic editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 21:26:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: How WordPress Improves\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=9980\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/how-wordpress-improves/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10224:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a> explores the WordPress release process.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so last week, we wrapped up and shipped the WordPress 5.7 release. The release team this time around was smaller than we&#8217;ve had in the last couple of years. By the numbers, it looks really good: 66 enhancements or feature requests went in, 127 bugs were fixed, and seven versions of a Gutenberg plugin were merged and backported. If you use WordPress, you are probably aware that we have new releases throughout the year, but you probably don&#8217;t know much about the release process. There&#8217;s not really a reason to know unless you&#8217;re actively contributing to a release. For those interested in knowing more about how we improve WordPress, this week&#8217;s exploration is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna take a look at what goes into WordPress releases and just kind of zoom our way in from the highest level. At the highest level, there are three major WordPress releases a year, plus the minor releases, plus Gutenberg releases. So if you&#8217;re following current WordPress work and future WordPress work, that&#8217;s going to get you to probably around <strong>30 releases a year</strong>. If we zoom in one level to the release itself, a single release of WordPress takes four to five months from start to the day that we ship, and an additional four to six weeks on support and translations, and minor releases after that. If you&#8217;re looking from my vantage point, you&#8217;ll see that WordPress releases have essentially five parts, some of which happen kind of simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part is planning and includes the project lead, lead developers, design; groups like that. The second phase is the creation phase when we&#8217;re actually building the things that have to go into the CMS that involves the design, core, editor, mobile, and other teams. Then there&#8217;s this phase that I like to refer to as the distribution phase. This is mostly done by the teams that make sure that WordPress is widely distributable; the polyglots team work on translations, accessibility does some work, docs make sure that everything is documented, and training, of course, gets things ready for when we have to be able to tell people how to use the release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there is the fourth phase; I really don&#8217;t think they go sequentially or in a waterfall format. The fourth-ish phase that I include, and that I tend to see, is this extending and iteration phase. It&#8217;s the phase where we see our theme authors and our plugin authors, folks who are doing support, show up and help us to make sure that WordPress is available not only widely but broadly to ensure that their audiences as theme authors and plugin authors are covered in the features that they need based on what they are using WordPress for. The fifth phase is the part of our communication that involves the community team, especially marketing, WordPressTV, and learn.wordpress.org. Basically, anyone who&#8217;s showing up to make sure that we all share what happened in the release, the features that are coming, and how that affects the users is involved in that particular phase. So five big phases of what happens over those four to five months, and then for the month or month and a half afterward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we zoom in a bit more on the creation phase, each release has people who lead the work and coordinate contributor efforts during the course of the release. For any given release, hundreds of people contribute and receive credit for moving the WordPress project forward. Okay, hold on a second. Let&#8217;s pump the brakes and zoom in a bit on that. Hundreds of people work on every major release for a project that powers over 40% of the web that feels like a small number. But for the people who process the contributions in preparation for release, it&#8217;s actually pretty substantial. For every release, there is a small team of leaders who asked the hard questions. Is this a usable feature? Does this make WordPress better overall? And, of course, is this ready to ship?&nbsp; Some of those leaders, a smaller subset of even the leaders that we have already, are committers who actually prep and merge patches to the CMS; they don&#8217;t do all the work to create a design or write all the code. This tiny group of people processes hundreds and hundreds of bug fixes, improvements, and enhancements that have been submitted over the course of months and sometimes years. As a side note, that whole process is a little smaller, a little faster in the Gutenberg featured plugin, but the basic parts are still there. Alright, so we&#8217;ve zoomed from the big picture way into some of the finer details, and it really looks like any other project cycle. So now, I&#8217;m going to layer in the filter of open source to that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of things that make building software in an open source environment so different. The first is that the code is readily available. If you have a basic understanding of the languages, you can see the code, learn from it, and make suggestions about improving it. Second, you consider the user a co-developer in the process, which means that as long as people use your product, they will have opinions on what you shipped. This way of iterating improves WordPress and ties back to one of my favorite open source principles. The idea that with many eyes, all bugs are shallow. To me, that means that with enough people looking at a problem, someone is bound to be able to see the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our community highlight, the segment where I share a note about contributors who have helped others along the way or a WordPress success story. This week&#8217;s highlight is from Nok in our Bangkok community. When asked to help her find her way into the WordPress community, she said, “@shinichiN who started the WordPress community in Bangkok and encouraged me to contribute, and also @mayukojpn has introduced me to the WP community team to join as a deputy. “ Thank you for sharing those two inspiring people with us. And if you, listener, have any stories that you would like to share of your own WordPress success or people that you have been so grateful to help you find your way in the project, you can feel free to email those to me at <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@wordpress.org\">wpbriefing@wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our final segment of the WP Briefing, the small list of big things. I only have three things to share with you this week. The first one is that about a week ago, we had our first release of 2021. It was the WordPress 5.7 release, titled Esperanza. If you have not yet seen it, go ahead and update your website or check with your host and make sure that they have updated you if you&#8217;re on a managed host. And then take a listen to the artists that it&#8217;s named after.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I want you to keep an eye out for is wordpress.org/news. We are starting a new series of content that gets at the heart of some of Gutenberg’s basic parts; there’s a lot of change coming up in the next few releases of WordPress. And the most important thing to me is that you understand what we&#8217;re trying to change and where those changes are primarily taking place. There will be a couple of tutorials that go up there over the course of the of the next few weeks. The third item on the small list of big things is to remind you of our call for testing. As I mentioned earlier in the podcast, the users of any open source software are the code developers; the software built is supposed to make your life and work easier. When you test things and find interactions that can use a little bit of refinement or features that are not working exactly as expected, it&#8217;s incredibly helpful for us to have that information to always make sure that we&#8217;re solving problems instead of accidentally creating them. If you want to participate in the Current call for testing, you can head over to make.wordpress.org/test. Or, if you&#8217;ve been doing your own testing, you can also submit any bugs you have found in the GitHub repo, which I will share in the show notes below. So that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:15:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Josepha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Talking Full Site Editing with Matías Ventura\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=10013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/03/talking-full-site-editing-with-matias-ventura/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31292:\"<p>In this episode, Josepha is joined by Matías Ventura, also known as “the spark behind the vision of Gutenberg.” Josepha and Matías discuss full site editing and answer your questions, from “is full site editing a standalone plugin?” to “will full site editing break my current site?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [0:41]: This month, we have a bonus briefing, so I&#8217;ve asked my dear friend and colleague <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matveb/\">Matías Ventura</a> to join me. Matías was recently called “the spark behind the vision of Gutenberg.” With full site editing coming our way in 202, I asked if he would join me for a quick Q&amp;A. Welcome, Matías.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [0:56]: Hello, hello! Thanks for inviting me. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [1:00]: Well, I&#8217;m delighted to have you. And I think that we have a lot of excellent questions. All right, so Matías, we actually ended up with questions in about three different groupings. And so I&#8217;m going to start with the “what is it about full site editing,” sorts of questions that people had. We&#8217;re gonna work our way into “what are we doing with it?” and then “how are we planning on getting this out the door?” Then, a couple of big picture questions that people asked. We&#8217;re just gonna leap right in this full site editing part of the Gutenberg plugin, or is it a standalone plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [1:39]: Okay, we&#8217;ll start with the basics. Full site editing is part of the Gutenberg plugin right now. I think it&#8217;s important to mention that full site editing is like an umbrella for several projects that we&#8217;re working on. They are all aiming to bring blocks into more parts of your site so that editing becomes easier and more expressive, and so on. So full site editing right now encompasses adding a ton of new blocks. I think we have around 20 new blocks coming in, including navigation query, site, title, logo, etc. There&#8217;s also the interface to interact with templates outside of the content; that&#8217;s another big part of the full site editing project. We also have a lot of new design tools included, many of these have been released in previous major releases, but they still comprise a strong part of what full site editing is. We also have something called Global Styles, which aims to allow people to configure the visual aspects of blogs across the entire site, not just on any individual blog. And of course, then there&#8217;s a whole layer of how we utilize these tools. It can get complex because there are many layers and projects that need to come together. So yeah, all of these are accessible through the Gutenberg plugin right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [3:07]: Yeah. So it&#8217;s not a standalone plugin. If you wanted to check out full site editing the site editor experience as it is now, you would just have to make sure you had the Gutenberg plugin on your site. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías: Yes, correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha:&nbsp; So a couple of the questions related to this are how exactly do I enable it on my site? And what is the easiest and safest way to try this on my site? And I think the answer is, is right in there. It&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. And so if you have that plugin, you don&#8217;t need the testing plugin or anything else to make that work, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [3:51]:&nbsp; No, you like, you might need to install a theme like Twenty Twenty One blocks that unlock some of these new interfaces that we just talked about. Like other of these pieces are available for anything. But some of these, like the interface to edit templates, right now only talk with things that know how to express their desire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [4:14]: And I think we have less than 10 themes right now that do that, but I&#8217;ll leave some links to at least 2021 blocks in the show notes. And then, if there are another one or two themes that I can find, I can add those in there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have to have the Gutenberg plugin; you have to have a theme that works with that site editor kind of experience. And then you&#8217;re safe to try everything out. It shows up in your left toolbar just like any other thing, like if you were working with plugins, or if you were adding a post or anything else, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [4:51]: Yes, correct. And so, some of these details are being worked on right now. Like how and where you access things, and so on. These things are subject to change, but right now, you have this site editor beta in the sidebar when both you have the plugin running and a theme that&#8217;s capable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [5:10]: Yeah. Excellent note. If you are running this on a production website, I would recommend you not do that unless you are very, very good with WordPress. It&#8217;s a really safe and easy thing to test and try out. But because it is still in beta, I recommend always putting it on a test site. I have a couple of different test sites that I run on myself. Another question that I had was, “will full site editing slow down my site?” And I think we have some refreshed performance tests coming out about that. And maybe they&#8217;ll be out by the time we publish this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [5:49]: Yeah, I mean, like the performance has been one of the major focuses for the whole project. In many cases, it should speed up things because we&#8217;re like, I think one of the big pieces that these projects bring into the picture, especially for themes, is that it allows only the necessary assets to be loaded on the front end. For example, if for a given page, there are, I don&#8217;t know, 10-15 blocks being used, you would only get the CSS and scrapes and so on related to those blocks. This can cut down on a lot a ton of CSS that themes used to end queue on a side, particularly if you were trying to customize many widgets and so on, like a lot of themes have the full styles or multiple widgets, even third party plugins, and so on. So one of the advantages of having this blog system is that we can know at the time of rendering what blogs are being used and only load those assets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [6:50]: Excellent. Another big question that we have is, “does full site editing work with the classic editor? And does it work with other builders?” I think that&#8217;s a really big answer if you&#8217;re going to get super deep into it. But I think that the short answer is yes, it does. Is that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [7:08]: Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it touches a bit on that full site editing is not like a single thing. There are multiple projects around it. So again, like the template editor that only deals with blogs, it doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do with a classic editor. But the classic editor use for both doesn&#8217;t change anything at all; like the same way that when the block editor was introduced, it didn&#8217;t change how you could still write posts in the classic editor. You will still be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [7:41]: And if you are brand new to WordPress person, or, I mean, I guess at this point, you don&#8217;t have to be super brand new. If you&#8217;re fairly new to WordPress person and have no idea what we&#8217;re talking about when we say the classic editor, you don&#8217;t really have to worry about it either. You don&#8217;t have to go and find out what that is; the block editor that you have right now works perfectly for what you&#8217;re trying to do. So if you don&#8217;t know what I mean when I say classic editor, don&#8217;t worry about chasing it down either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that this last question we accidentally answered earlier, but I&#8217;m going to go ahead and ask it anyway since I received it. “I keep hearing that you can use the site editor with the 2021 theme. But I don&#8217;t seem to be able to. What am I missing?” I think the answer is that there&#8217;s the Twenty Twenty One theme shipped with the WordPress release 5.6. And then there is the Twenty Twenty One blocks theme; those are two different themes. The link to the Twenty Twenty One block theme is going to be in our show notes this time around. And so, if you have been trying to use the full site editor with Twenty Twenty One and not succeeding, try the link to the one below. And I bet that that will work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [8:50]: Yes, that&#8217;s correct.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [8:51]: All right, excellent. Well, that brings us kind of into our second set of questions, which is about how we are doing it. The first one that folks have is “will full site editing be on by default in the next release. In this context, the next release is WordPress 5.8. But I think it&#8217;s a safe question to ask if full site editing will be on by default in the release that it&#8217;s planned for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [9:15]: Yeah, and for this, I need to go back to the same principle of many projects because there are many pieces of full site editing, and we have been merging them in major releases, particularly like the blocks and the design tools. There are more coming in that we want to make accessible as soon as possible. The full experience that requires a theme to opt-in to templates using blogs won’t be by default; it requires a specific theme running. A lot of these details we&#8217;re still like determining exactly what projects are ready to be merged and so on. But yeah, if you have a theme right now that works the way you want, it doesn&#8217;t change anything there. If anything, it adds some more capabilities and more customization tools, and so on. And the theme can also regulate how much they want to incorporate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [10:13]: Matías, you&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times in this podcast so far like this is a really complex and really complicated part of this work. And just for anyone out there who&#8217;s either encountering Gutenberg or full site editing or this podcast for the first time, I think a tiny bit of context that&#8217;s worth having here is that Matías and I have been working on this together in various capacities for like, five years. And Matías has probably been working on this for practically a decade. So, when we say that this is a really complicated problem, and when we say that this is a complex set of issues that we&#8217;re working with like, it is all that we have been thinking about for I want to say at least the last three or four years, but certainly it&#8217;s all that we have been trying to untangle for quite a bit of time before that as well. So we don&#8217;t take it lightly when we&#8217;re like, “this is complicated;” we mean it. It&#8217;s really complicated. And we&#8217;re trying our hardest over here as WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next big question, since we&#8217;re all stuck in the “it&#8217;s very complicated,” part of things is the question, “will this update break my current site?” Like, if I have a site that is updated and ready, and it&#8217;s exactly as I wanted it to be, and it took me two years to get there will full site editing, whichever release it&#8217;s in. Currently, 5.8 is what we&#8217;re planning for. Will that break anything on my site as I know it right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [11:44]: No, not at all. One of the major things that the WordPress team, the WordPress community, always cares so much about, never to break things. Many of these things are stepping stones that you can adopt, as we&#8217;ve talked about full site editing. But for example, we also have a few concurrent projects around the widget screen and the navigation screen that are meant to bring blocks into existing interfaces. So again, the theme doesn&#8217;t need to change, and a lot of care is being put into making this more like you&#8217;re unlocking new features, and nothing really breaks or falls apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [12:23]: This update, like all the other updates, should have minimal, minimal impact on what you have to actively fix on your site. Every once in a while, a bug is gonna get by. We can&#8217;t say that we&#8217;re 100% perfect with not breaking things. But also, we always and I and I know that we&#8217;re planning on this for our remaining releases for the rest of the year. At the very least, I can&#8217;t imagine we&#8217;d ever change it. But after every major release, we always make a plan to have a minor release within the next one or two weeks. Because we know that a broken thing on a site is really incredibly impactful, even if you&#8217;re only 1% of the sites that had that happen to it. And so I think that&#8217;s true in this case, too. And getting that feedback back from all of the people who are actually using WordPress is the thing that makes us be able to kind of move quickly when we do see those problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the questions that we have been getting is, “can I see a live preview without saving the changes that I made?” When I got this question, I didn&#8217;t actually understand it. And so I went and looked at a site without the Gutenberg plugin on it, and then a site with the Gutenberg plugin on it. And of course, on sites without Gutenberg, without the block editor, without full site editing, when you are looking to preview, you have the option to open up your preview in a new window. And you don&#8217;t have that with Gutenberg because it&#8217;s supposed to be a true WYSIWYG editor. A true what you see is what you get, editor. I think that the answer to this is, yes, you can see a live preview without actually saving the changes on the front end of your site. But you don&#8217;t actually have to reload anything. You don&#8217;t have to open it up in a new window. You don&#8217;t have to, like, actively click “please show me a preview” because what you see in your editing screen should be what you see at the end of your app as an end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [14:28]: Yeah, that&#8217;s the sort of the main gist to it. Yes, the site editor is built so that it always reflects the front end as truly as possible, so that&#8217;s one layer. Also, the preview tools should allow you to see in different devices like mobile breakpoints, and I don&#8217;t know if they will have breakpoints and stuff like that. There are a lot of things in the current interface that is just not enabled. There are some challenges in the sidebar. Because the site editor is not just focused on a single post, it&#8217;s focused on the entire site. So, there can be many, many changes that need to be shadowed for the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re changing the site title, some of the global styles, aspects, and so on need to be orchestrated. So, to see in the previewing new window, there are some challenges there to integrate. Again, the interface is not final yet; a lot of these things are still being tweaked and improved. There are many things from the regular post editor that are not enabled yet. But they will be enabled. So yeah, it&#8217;s a, I guess, it&#8217;s not a simple thing to answer. Because, again, the idea of previewing the site that&#8217;s core to the whole project is that you&#8217;re always interacting in the same way that when you&#8217;re in the customizer, you&#8217;re seeing the preview all the time. That&#8217;s the main scope of this project,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [15:54]: Excellent. Changes like that changes to your workflow can be really hard to get your mind around, especially if part of that existing workflow was there to create some confidence in what you&#8217;re seeing with your users. And so I understand. Now that I&#8217;ve researched that question a bit, I see where that&#8217;s coming from. Based on existing workflows and existing patterns that we have for ourselves in WordPress, will we need to have a theme to use the full site editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [16:33]: I think we&#8217;ve already covered some of these. And again, they are tools that can work on any existing theme. There is other stuff that needs space-specific themes to opt-in into these tools, like blog templates and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [16:50]: Yes, I think the question that we have next, because I see that the literal next question I have is actually something we have covered; just because we&#8217;re being pretty conversational about it, not because anyone already asked the question. So I&#8217;m actually going to skip to the last question of this section that I received. I got this next one via Twitter. The question is, “how do you view the role of themes once full site editing is fully rolled out and all the page elements (content, headers, widgets, footers, etc.) and all the views are managed via blocks and block patterns? Will things become typographic and block styles?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [17:28]: I think this is a great question because it goes to the heart of, why are we doing all this. One of the main reasons is to empower users more. WordPress has been democratizing publishing for a while; this is another step into allowing themes to get more customization tools and more control over their site if they want to. I think the recent call for testing has focused on the 404 page, for example. That&#8217;s something that forever has been locked away from users. And it&#8217;s also something that, as a theme developer, and I used to develop themes a long time ago, that was one of the things where you decide what sort of approach you take for the 404 page. Maybe sometimes you want to have something more whimsical. Sometimes you need something more serious. And committing to one when you can have such a diverse and broad user base can be challenging. With these, it becomes as easy as offering a few different patterns for that template. Then the user will always be able to change the copy and modify something. So again, it opens up a lot of these things that used to be locked down. However, from a theme perspective, I think this doesn&#8217;t reduce the theme at all. If anything, it allows the theme to focus less on coding and functions and more on design expression and aesthetics. I don&#8217;t think that would ever be exhausted. That will always remain as diverse as humans are interacting with WordPress. And so it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t see it&#8217;s just as like, typographic and block styles. How do you express a template, how do you express the structure, what choices you quote, what choices you make as a theme builder? And of course, there are many degrees of control there. Because a site maintainer may not want the 404 template to be editable, that sort of control will always be present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [19:38]: Yeah. And really fast. I have to add a caveat to a thing that you said in there. For anyone who&#8217;s listening keenly, you may have heard Matías say that the users can update any of the content there &#8211; any of the copy. In this context, we&#8217;re talking about users as in the people who are maintaining the site, not people who are visiting your site. Visitors to your site will not be able to change any copy on your page unless you&#8217;ve done something very interesting with your WordPress site, which is also fine if that&#8217;s what you prefer to do. By default, your visitors can&#8217;t change everything on your website, which is good news, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve got one logistics question, which I&#8217;m happy to take. And then one is kind of a big picture question that I also got from Twitter. “What about the classic editor block; what is going to happen to that? And when will we know?” So ages and ages ago, before COVID? I think so. Probably maybe a couple of years ago, Matt said that the classic editor plugin would be supported through the end of 2021. And that is still the case; there will be active support on that through the end of 2021. After that, it will not be actively supported anymore. It won&#8217;t be removed from any place that you can get access to right now. In a “this is the end of its lifecycle” sort of way, we just won&#8217;t have anyone who is currently committed to maintaining that plugin anymore. So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening at the end of the year. And yeah, at the end of 2021. The big question that we have is, “why is full site editing being so rushed?” I think this is a bit of a loaded question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [21:32]: Yeah, I think I think it&#8217;s still a fair question, though. I think we&#8217;re dealing with two things here. And one is ensuring that we release things in the best state possible. And also, some of the urgency is to offer tools that we know that people lack right now and that could really benefit from. Making that determination is very tricky. The full site editing project has been in the works for the last couple of years. If we count the initial phase of Gutenberg, that&#8217;s four to five years. We&#8217;ve been doing many calls for testing, which I think have been super useful to catch issues and reflect as a community on where things are going; how do we integrate with these? How do we use it? What are the shortcomings? What do we need to do? Based on all of these, we&#8217;ll continue to make decisions on when things become ready. We&#8217;re not committed to releasing something that&#8217;s not in a good state. And I think we will always be very careful about that. There are these two competing senses of the urgency &#8211; of getting some of these tools out, and because it also benefits from the feedback loops. I always say that, in many ways, the initial phase of Gutenberg, to me, is not finished. We took the initial two years to do the 5.0 release, the initial block editor, and so on. But, it&#8217;s still being improved at a very fast pace, among all the recent major releases improvements to the editor were included; that will continue to be the case. In many ways, phase one is not finished. And the moment we choose to release some of these tools or editing tools, it won&#8217;t be finished either. They will need to continue to grow, mature, and incorporate a lot of the feedback. Even the things that the ecosystem is building around. I&#8217;ve seen a few themes already that are incorporating a blank canvas template so that you can use them in some pages and take over and do everything with blocks. So even the community and ecosystem as a whole is also sort of paving the way for what needs to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [24:06]: I think from my perspective, and of course, I&#8217;m on the people side of things, the communication side of things, the logistics side of things; I have a frequently a very different view from what a lot of other folks are seeing. And so from my side of things, I have to say, I&#8217;m communicating about this change in a really broad way, which has not been happening since 2019 when we started the work. We&#8217;ve been communicating broadly with the WordPress community, but not with everybody who uses WordPress. So, I think that for a lot of people, this looks like a project that we started really actively working on in the last six months or so. And now we&#8217;re just racing toward a finish line. I think that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s not been a lot of awareness of everything that&#8217;s gone into it. And so, on the one hand, it feels a little less rushed to me knowing the full length of the history on this. But also, as you said, I really think that this gets a bunch of tools to people who otherwise have not been able to accomplish these things in WordPress or otherwise. I am so anxious to get something to people who really can benefit from this change the most. And it&#8217;s the nature of the open source, right that like, one, as long as you have users, you&#8217;re going to have stuff you have to fix in your software. So we&#8217;re never really, really going to be done with this; there&#8217;s not going to be like a done point of WordPress. And the second thing is, I think it&#8217;s generally true that you don&#8217;t really start getting full user feedback until after you have launched your major release. I think that we see that a lot in open source software; you can bring in as many people as you think you can in your user tests heading up to it. And in your accessibility tests. And, in general, quality assurance tests. You can bring in a lot of people and still not have gotten the full understanding of the various niche use cases that your users will bring to you. Because at this point, we&#8217;re like 40% of the web. And that means that we&#8217;re serving this majority collection of increasingly minority voices and niche voices in the space. And so, a little bit I feel a sense of urgency; I feel a bit of anxiousness about trying to get this out there for one, to get the tools in the hands of the people who can benefit the most from them, but also so that we can start really getting the full stress test of this software out and get that feedback in so that we can really build something responsive to what our users need our long tail, “anyone who ever uses WordPress ever,” definition of users. And so, that&#8217;s why I feel a sense of urgency around it. Even though you know, as I said, you and I have been working on this for like five years, and you&#8217;ve been working on it for a decade or something. I actually don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s been worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:35]: Now that makes me feel a bit old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [27:40]: Nobody makes Matías feel old. He is a lovely, wonderful colleague. Sorry, Matías, If I made you feel old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [27:46]: No, that&#8217;s totally fine. I also want to add that full site editing is not like a single toggle that&#8217;s going to drop into a major release. So I think that&#8217;s important to consider, I think this entire year is going to see a lot of these tools being, and sometimes the sort of the end-user is not the, again, the site maintainer. Still, you can also be the theme developer; I think there are many tools that would be empowering for theme developers to use. Again, we mentioned there are like five to ten themes, block themes right now. That needs to grow a lot, and that only grows through these sorts of feedback loops. And the theme community pushing things forward and seeing where things can lead to. I&#8217;m very excited about the pattern directory integration because I think that can also combine with blog themes in very powerful ways. Imagine if, I don&#8217;t know many of these patterns that are very common on the web and very needed, that if we can refine them together with a second community and make them available across themes, you can combine a header from one theme with a content of another; all these sorts of mixtures could happen. All of this needs exploration, the creativity of the entire community, and so on. In that sense, getting all these tools, even if it doesn&#8217;t immediately change anything for like the site itself, starts to unlock a lot of things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [29:27]: I&#8217;m going to take a bit of your answer from there and tie it all the way back to your first answer that we had when you joined me today. And say, I think you&#8217;re absolutely right. We have a set of users in our theme authors and our plugin developers as well that we desperately need to get looking at this set of tools. I hope that what we are shipping in the first iteration of this serves as an opportunity for all of those theme authors and agency owners, plugin authors, WordPress site configurers freelancers. Like, I really hope that this puts it into a really accessible, easy-to-access space for them so that they can do those experiments based on what they know their users need the most. They are the group that has the closest access to site maintainers. And what they need compared to, for instance, me or a potential you like we have a lot of information, you and I, we do a lot of tests, we have a strong sense of what is needed at the moment, but we don&#8217;t have as a close connection that our theme and agency and plugin folks all have. And so that&#8217;s another part of why I&#8217;m so excited to get this out in the current iteration of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:04]: That was a lot of questions in a little bit of time. This is going to be officially my longest WordPress briefing. Matías, I am so glad that you were able to join me today. And I think that everyone&#8217;s going to be really, really excited to hear your answers to these questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matías [31:23]: Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha [31:25]: All right, my friends. That brings us into our small list of big things. I&#8217;m going to skip our community highlight today just because we had a slightly longer word press briefing in our bonus iteration today. But the small list of big things. The first thing is WordCamp Central America is coming up on April 15; there is a registration link in the show notes that you can access your tickets with. I recommend that you go; we&#8217;ve got a lot of excellent speakers coming up there and a lot of good content and good training and learning for y&#8217;all. The second thing is that Matt Mullenweg and I have listening hours coming up with the community in the first week of April. I&#8217;ll add the link to register for those in the show notes as well; it&#8217;s just a few minutes for you all to stop by, check-in, see what&#8217;s going on, and share some celebrations or concerns with us.

The WordPress Juke Box. For the inaugural episode host Nathan Wrigley interviewed. Among other things, <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> talked about her benchmark for the Go/NoGo decision to merge Full-Site Editing into core for the 5.8 release in July. Find additional thoughts in my post: <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/full-site-editing-mvp-can-i-build-a-landing-page/\"><strong>Full-site Editing MVP: Can I Build a Landing Page?</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> posted the fourth call for testing: <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\">Building a restaurant themed header</a></strong>, with instructions to use columns, navigation block and other features for the header template part. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of movement on the Gutenberg Repo and the Themes Team keeps a list of relevant issues and discussions for theme developers. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/one_maggie\"><strong>Maggie Cabrera</strong></a> published the round-up post <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/03/26/gutenberg-themes-week-of-march-25-2021/\">Gutenberg + Themes: Week of March 25, 2021</a></strong>. It&#8217;s an excellent reading list if you need to dive deeper in the upcoming changes for your theme or your customer. One of the issues caught my eye: the discussion and work around block alignment settings for themes. The current way predates the revamp of the Inner Blocks. There is some work to be done, streamlining the styling for themes. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29506\">Join the discussion on GitHub</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index-2020/\">The index 2020 is here</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-refactor-of-the-gallery-block-using-image-blocks\">Refactor of the Gallery Block, using image blocks. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love to take a sneak peek at the new version of the Gallery block, heed the call for testing by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/glendaviesnz\"><strong>Glen</strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/glendaviesnz\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/glendaviesnz\"><strong>Davies</strong>:</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/23/gallery-block-update-call-for-testing/\"><strong>Gallery Block Update – Call for Testing</strong></a>. The refactored version is now using single image blocks inside the Gallery block. You can us all the great features: individual links per image, block styles, choices for size and editing capabilities. If you also use a plugin with your site, like CoBlocks, you can still apply the great filters and animations to your gallery block. In his post, Davies walks you through the few features and asked to test all the many facets of the new Gallery block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the WPTavern, <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> explains how this new change can make a lot of difference on how gallery layouts will be built. Among other ideas, he pictures that among images, a Pull Quote block could be added. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/refactoring-gutenbergs-gallery-block-to-support-nested-images\">Refactoring Gutenberg’s Gallery Block To Support Nested Images</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/23/gallery-block-update-call-for-testing/#comment-40962\">my first impression as a comment</a> and created <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/30250\">a bug report on GitHub</a> when my images lost all their styling when I added the gallery block to a group. I suggested making it possible to apply block styles to more than one image at a time, and that the gallery block / image block copies the respective Alt texts from the media library. Both suggestions made it into the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/56#card-57737540\">project board.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-block-editor-for-content-creators\">Block editor for content creators</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/liamdempsey\"><strong>Liam Dempsey</strong></a> asked his Twitter followers for recommendation of Block plugins.

He continues: <em>&#8220;The Blank Canvas Template hides everything on the page except the blocks you add to the Block Editor content.

This week, the discussion&rsquo;s facilitator, H&eacute;ctor Prieto, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/25/discussion-summary-dropping-support-for-ie11/\">confirmed</a> the majority of participants are in agreement to move forward and set a timeline for discontinuing support. Contributors are now considering either the 5.8. or 5.9 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The argument for dropping in 5.8 is to realize the change and improvement quicker, while others are inclined to wait until 5.9 to provide a longer window between the official announcement and the effective date,&rdquo; Prieto said. The final call is up the the 5.8 release team, which has not yet been identified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release scope and schedule hinges on whether or not the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/03/12/full-site-editing-pre-merge-overview/\">April go/no-go conditions</a> are met for including full-site editing in the merge for 5.8 (July 2021) or 5.9 (December 2021). Teams for 5.8 will be finalized in April/May, and they will decide how to proceed for discontinuing IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jb Audras suggested that if 5.8 release leads elect to drop support for IE11,  he could work with other contributors to update the BrowseHappy notice in one of the upcoming minor versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Even if the BrowseHappy notice can be updated independently from&nbsp;Core&nbsp;releases, I think it&rsquo;s better to update alongside a release, to give better visibility to this change,&rdquo; Audras said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft 365 apps and services will no longer support IE11 <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666\">beginning August 17, 2021</a>. Drupal recently went through a similar process of deciding to drop IE11 support with the upcoming Drupal 10 release, anticipated in June 2022. Those who have to use IE11 retain the option to remain on Drupal 9&rsquo;s LTS release until the end of 2023. Participants in the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3155358\">discussion</a> cited many of the same considerations now facing WordPress contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/04/discussion-dropping-support-for-ie11/#comment-40870\">commented</a> on the preliminary discussion to suggest giving IE11 users a path forward if they land on wp-admin using an unsupported browser: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Supportive of dropping support, and if someone visits on an explicitly dropped browser like IE11 showing them a friendly message saying why wp-admin&nbsp;is not accessible and next steps they can take.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical implementation is being discussed in the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48743\">ticket</a> Riad Benguella created to discourage IE11 usage and WordPress&rsquo; projects and teams will begin examining the practical implications of dropping support.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 23:32:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: 10up Creates Classic Post Migration Route With Its Convert to Blocks WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114406\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:235:\"https://wptavern.com/10up-creates-classic-post-migration-route-with-its-convert-to-blocks-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10up-creates-classic-post-migration-route-with-its-convert-to-blocks-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3803:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Yesterday, 10up officially announced <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2021/convert-to-blocks/\">Convert to Blocks</a>, a WordPress plugin for transforming classic posts into blocks. The goal is to provide users with a safe migration route for old content while removing the burdens of other options in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I briefly mentioned this plugin in an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-how-to-bulk-convert-classic-wordpress-posts-to-blocks\">article covering bulk conversion</a> in the Ask the Bartender series. However, I could not recommend it to most users because it was <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/convert-to-blocks\">hosted on GitHub</a>, a site that is geared toward developers. With it now officially in the WordPress plugin directory, it is a much more user-friendly option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most conversion options either convert posts in bulk or through a manual process, such as the user clicking a button. Bulk converters can be problematic at a large scale simply because there is no reliable way for users to check the success of each post&rsquo;s conversion to blocks. Of course, users could check these posts individually, but that is impractical when dealing with more than a few dozen posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulk converters are also done so in conjunction with a database backup. It is sensible to do this when altering large amounts of content at once just to be on the safe side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We saw a space for a third way &mdash; a solution that eliminates editors stumbling upon Classic blocks and needing to know how to convert them, while also holding back on content transformation until content needs to be modified &mdash; at which point it is also, typically, checked again on the front end of the site,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2021/convert-to-blocks/\">wrote Darshan Sawardekar</a>, a 10up lead web engineer, in the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the idea for Convert to Blocks came into play. It began as a creative engineering solution to mitigate risk and improve content mapping. Its success inspired the development and public release of the plugin to help others facilitate safe content migrations to the WordPress block editor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up&rsquo;s solution is a bit of a middle ground. It only converts a post when a user enters the editing screen for it. From that point, the user can check whether the conversion looks correct, fix any problems if they arise, and save the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Converted gallery post.\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, it works the same as the default convert-to-blocks options in WordPress without the manual step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many users, this is the ideal solution. Because classic content works the same as it always has on the front end, it is unnecessary to convert it unless the need to edit the post also arises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convert to Blocks also adds a new column to the manage posts screen named &ldquo;Editor.&rdquo; It lists whether the post content was created with either the block or classic editor, providing users with an at-a-glance look without checking posts individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Additional &ldquo;Editor&rdquo; column on the manage posts screen.\n\n\n\n<p>Like other plugins, Convert to Blocks uses the core transformation feature, which is an imperfect solution. Depending on the content of the post, the conversion will sometimes throw an error. That is why bulk solutions are often problematic. With this plugin, users will know immediately upon editing a post if there is an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the plugins available today for converting classic posts to blocks, this would be my top choice. It focuses on transforming to blocks where it matters &mdash; during the editing process &mdash; and removes some manual work for the user.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 16:01:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: Free Software Community Condemns Richard Stallman’s Reinstatement to FSF Board of Directors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:245:\"https://wptavern.com/free-software-community-condemns-richard-stallmans-reinstatement-to-fsf-board-of-directors?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=free-software-community-condemns-richard-stallmans-reinstatement-to-fsf-board-of-directors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7505:\"<p>GPL author Richard Stallman <a href=\"https://streamable.com/nzthxn\">announced</a> this week that he has rejoined the board of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), which he established in 1985, and is not planning to resign a second time:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;I have an announcement to make. I&rsquo;m now on the Free Software Foundation Board of Directors once again. We were working on a video to announce this with, but that turned out to be difficult, we didn&rsquo;t have experience doing that sort of thing so it didn&rsquo;t get finished but here is the announcement. Some of you will be happy at this, and some might be disappointed, but who knows? In any case, that&rsquo;s how it is, and I&rsquo;m not planning to resign a second time.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Stallman <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gpl-author-richard-stallman-resigns-from-free-software-foundation\">resigned</a> as director of the board and president of the FSF, and was subsequently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gnu-project-maintainers-move-to-oust-richard-stallman-from-leadership\">ousted by GNU project maintainers</a> from his position as head of the project. Calls for his removal were precipitated by Stallman&rsquo;s controversial remarks on rape, assault, and child sex trafficking, along with two decades of <a href=\"https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman\">behaviors and statements</a> that many have found to be disturbing and offensive. His return came as a shock to the free software community, though some suspect he never really left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I did not support the decision to reinstate RMS,&rdquo; former FSF board member Kat Walsh <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mindspillage/status/1374448587388588037\">said</a> after resigning from the board yesterday. &ldquo;I made my arguments and placed my opposing vote; while I was glad I was able to do that I regret not being able to turn the decision the other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wish the organization well; my departure is not a rejection of the ideas of free software, only a belief that my role in the organization was no longer the best way to put them forward into the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement came with a staggering lack of transparency from FSF&rsquo;s board of directors and has triggered a cascade of condemnation from individuals and organizations across the tech industry. Among the many critical responsibilities it maintains, the FSF currently&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#History\" target=\"_blank\">holds the copyrights to enforce the GPL</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Source Initiative published a <a href=\"https://opensource.org/OSI_Response\">statement</a> this week, calling for Stallman&rsquo;s removal from FSF&rsquo;s leadership:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Open Source Initiative calls upon the Free Software Foundation to hold Stallman responsible for past behavior, remove him from the organization&rsquo;s leadership and work to address the harm he caused to all those he has excluded: those he considers less worthy, and those he has hurt with his words and actions. We will not participate in any events that include Richard M. Stallman and we cannot collaborate with the Free Software Foundation until Stallman is removed from the organization&rsquo;s leadership. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Hat <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-statement-about-richard-stallmans-return-free-software-foundation-board?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI\">announced</a> that it is suspending all funding of the FSF and any FSF-hosted events. Mozilla <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1374513444838199304\">joined</a> the Open Source Diversity Community, Outreachy, and the Software Conservancy project in supporting an <a href=\"https://rms-open-letter.github.io/\">open letter</a> that calls for the removal of the entire Board of the Free Software Foundation, along with the removal of Stallman from all leadership positions, including the GNU Project. The letter states that the undersigned do not acknowledge Stallman&rsquo;s leadership of the FSF and do not condone his actions and opinions:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There has been enough tolerance of RMS&rsquo;s repugnant ideas and behavior. We cannot continue to let one person ruin the meaning of our work. Our communities have no space for people like Richard M. Stallman, and we will not continue suffering his behavior, giving him a leadership role, or otherwise holding him and his hurtful and dangerous ideology as acceptable.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p> The petition has been signed by more than 2400 free software advocates. Notable signatories include Molly de Blanc (Debian Project, GNOME Foundation), Elana Hashman (Debian Technical Committee Member, Open Source Initiative Director, Kubernetes SIG Instrumentation Chair), Neil McGovern (GNOME Foundation Executive Director, Former Debian Project Leader), and Luis Villa (Former Director of the Open Source Initiative and the GNOME Foundation; contributor to the GPL v3 drafting process).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) published a <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/statement-re-election-richard-stallman-fsf-board\">statement</a> urging the voting members&nbsp;of the FSF board to call a special meeting to reconsider Stallman&rsquo;s reinstatement, in support of the &ldquo;long-term viability of the free software movement:&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Free software is a vital component of an open and just technological society: its key institutions and individuals cannot place misguided feelings of loyalty above their commitment to that cause. The movement for digital freedom is larger than any one individual contributor, regardless of their role. Indeed, we hope that this moment can be an opportunity to bring in new leaders and new ideas to the free software movement.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman still has many staunch supporters, as more than 2,000 people have signed an <a href=\"https://rms-support-letter.github.io/\">open letter</a> in support of him and his leadership. They contend that removing RMS &ldquo;will hurt FSF&rsquo;s image and will deal a significant blow to the momentum of the free software movement.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallman is still listed among the <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board\">FSF&rsquo;s board of directors</a>, but the board appears to be reorganizing. A preliminary <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/preliminary-board-statement-on-fsf-governance\">statement</a> on upcoming changes to the board&rsquo;s governance said they are moving to adopt a transparent, formal process for identifying candidates and appointing new board members.

In their conversation, they covered a lot of ground. The show is definitely worth your 40 minutes of listen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around minute 23 of the audio they talked a bit more about Full-Site Editing and its merge into the core. Chomphosy said she knows &#8216;this summer&#8217; is an ambitions goal, and she also assured the listeners that the team won&#8217;t release something that&#8217;s not functional and usable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go/NoGo Mid to End of April</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Core release and Gutenberg teams will make the Go/NoGo decision to merge Full-Site Editing for the next WordPress release in July (5.8)  on April 17 or on April 23.  In other words, the state of Full Site editing in Gutenberg plugin version 10.4 and 10.5.  If it doesn&#8217;t get merged into 5.8, Full-Site Editing will be merged in WordPress 5.9 to be released in December 2021</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy also shared her &#8211; unofficial &#8211; benchmark of what should be possible with the prototype of the Site Editor by April: Can you &#8211; without writing code &#8211; create a landing page with Full-site editing tools. She calls it &#8220;the smallest viable sentence. The I-AM of websites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Landing page is the smallest viable unit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This single web page consists of a header, a footer, a hero image with a button, some text, a form or a call to action.  This narrows the focus of the MVP, the prototype, considerably. It also increases the probability that the first low-key, opt-in version of Full-Site editing might actually make it into the next WordPress version. A narrow scope will also help content creators, teachers and developers get started working on their discovery of the new WordPress feature. As soon as it is merged into WordPress core, plugin developer and theme builders can test their ideas against it and get familiar with the underlying concepts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good way to ease-in content creators, too. When you are not dealing with the header and footer of a big site, but just for a single page, it’s not so critical if you get lost on the way from content editing to template part (header, footer) editing and back again. It&#8217;s all on the same page, literally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition was one of the major causes of confusion during the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/16/high-level-feedback-from-the-fse-program-march/\">first few testing calls for the FSE outreach program</a> and the developers are working on making it less confusing. With this unofficial benchmark of a single landing page creation, the team will have additional time and input on how to better handle that switch between editing a template that is used for many pages and the content of a single post or page content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A very tangible goal, &#8220;Can I build a landing page with the tools available?&#8221; makes it straightforward for WordPress contributors who work on the parts that make that are not code, like documentation, marketing, training and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Call For Testing: Create a Header</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\">4th call for testing</a> via the WordPress FSE-Outreach program asks you to<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\"> create a header for a Restaurant</a>. <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> has detailed instructions for you as well as video if you are in a testing mood. Your input is definitely wanted!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy also added that Matias Ventura, the technical lead for Gutenberg,  might have different benchmarks for the MVP. I am curious, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden/status/1371956586516606977\">answer Josepha&#8217;s call for questions</a> on Full-Site Editing for her next episode of the WPBriefing podcast when Matias will be her guest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-Side Editing project encompasses a lot more than the Site Editor with template parts. There are Global Styles, Widgets in Customizer, a new Navigation and Widget screen, block-based themes with a theme.json file and query block. Some of it will work its way into the MVP. We will see how far the team progresses on their journey, that will only begin once Full-Site editing comes to Millions of WordPress users. No Fear, though. It will all be opt-in. Nothing will break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-secondary-background-color has-text-color has-background has-large-font-size\">&#8220;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&#8221; &#8212; Eric Raymond&#8217;s Linus&#8217; Law</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-secondary-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<form class=\"wp-block-newsletterglue-form ngl-form ngl-portrait\" action=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/\" method=\"post\"><div class=\"ngl-form-container\"><div class=\"ngl-form-field\"><label class=\"ngl-form-label\" for=\"ngl_email\">Leave Your Email for our Weekend Edition</label><div class=\"ngl-form-input\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"ngl-form-input-text\" name=\"ngl_email\" id=\"ngl_email\" /></div></div><button class=\"ngl-form-button\">Subscribe</button><p class=\"ngl-form-text\">We hate spam, too.

The company officially acquired the plugin months ago. However, this was its first public outing as the new owner of a project that has seen a steady uptick in its popularity, recently surpassing 5,000 active installations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify was busy in late 2020. The company quietly purchased the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/\">Redux Framework</a> in November. D&#333;vy Paukstys, the creator, remained on board part-time with the financial backing needed to continue the project. In December, Extendify joined forces with Munir Kamal and his team behind Editor Plus and Gutenberg Hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our mission is to turn WordPress into a superpower for entrepreneurs around the world,&rdquo; said Extendify co-founder Chris Lubkert. &ldquo;As you know, despite its unrivaled popularity, many users still struggle to use WordPress to create the site they need. We see tremendous potential to empower WordPress users to create a Gutenberg-native website in a few clicks. By bringing together Redux, Editor Plus, and Gutenberg Hub, we have the foundational pieces to create a world-class onboarding and site-building experience.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no plans to build a &ldquo;super&rdquo; plugin that combines Editor Plus and Redux. Gutenberg Hub will continue providing resources to help users leverage the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Currently, the Redux template library and the library in Editor Plus are separate,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;But we are heavily investing in making the Extendify library the best solution for users and eventually plan to introduce this to the Redux user base as well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify&rsquo;s first public act as Editor Plus&rsquo;s owner was not to introduce new features in its recent major-release, version 2.7. Instead, users were presented with a limitation on features they previously had access to for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 2.7 limits the template and pattern inserter, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/editor-plus-2-6-adds-block-pattern-and-template-library\">introduced in 2.6</a>, to three imports. Beyond that, users must upgrade to one of the Extendify Pro paid tiers. The single-site option is $99 per year with an introductory rate of $49. The unlimited sites tier is $299, and it currently has a $149 limited-time offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Template and pattern inserter.\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, it seemed like a cash grab from new owners. There were no public announcements or explanations for the change outside of a minor note in the plugin&rsquo;s change log &mdash; just new ownership and upsells. Lubkert said he plans to rectify this by publishing an announcement post next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify had already been involved with new feature development for months. The API behind the template inserter was coming from their server in Editor Plus 2.6. It was the groundwork for Extendify Pro, but it was also still under development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a small, nimble team, and it was a development timing issue,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;We finished the library approximately three weeks before we finished paid plans, and we certainly didn&rsquo;t want to delay users getting their hands on the library while we finished up work on Extendify Pro.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will not lose any previously-imported templates. However, importing anything beyond three additional templates in Editor Plus 2.7 or newer will require a purchase of Extendify Pro for an API key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are now offering an added layer of value for users who want to benefit from the power of Editor Plus but may not be in a position to use it to create their site from scratch,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;For those users, we are creating the most beautiful and effective Gutenberg-native templates, built with Editor Plus, as part of the Extendify Pro template library. As you know, we launched the initial beta version a few weeks ago. A subscription is required for unlimited access to the library, but all users can import any three templates or patterns for free.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>With the launch of the template inserter in 2.6, there was no public mention of it being a beta version.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Templates and patterns from Gutenberg Hub remain free. Users can still browse the site, copy a template code snippet, and paste it into the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team removed the custom blocks extension in Editor Plus 2.7.1, released earlier today. This feature allowed end-users to copy blocks from the Gutenberg Hub block library, paste them into the plugin, and save them for use on the site. Users could also add custom blocks via this settings screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Removed custom block feature.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The custom block feature in Editor Plus was an experiment that was pretty cool, actually,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;However, [Kamal] suggested removing it from Editor Plus since it is now very similar to the reusable block functionality in core. We want Editor Plus to push the envelope of what is possible with Gutenberg, and having a duplicate feature that is available in core doesn&rsquo;t add real, incremental value for our users.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Updating to 2.7+ will also likely deactivate the plugin for end-users. The primary plugin filename changed from <code>index.php</code> to <code>editorplus.php</code>. Developers should generally avoid doing this because WordPress uses this filename to determine if a plugin is active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remain optimistic about Editor Plus&rsquo;s future now that it has the financial backing it deserves. Having been an early supporter of the project, I knew this day would come. Nearly every time I spoke with Kamal in the past, I asked him about plans for monetizing the product. It had grown beyond what one developer could reasonably handle and scale without a business plan in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We agree with your sentiment that WordPress projects need to generate revenue in order to fund the development of truly transformational experiences,&rdquo; said Lubkert. &ldquo;We have been investing in our team as well. Tammie Lister joined us as Head of Design. We&rsquo;ve also added engineering, support, and QA team members.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 21:44:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WordPress Foundation: 5 tips for organizing a successful online do_action charity hackathon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=182733\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2021/5-tips-for-organizing-a-successful-online-do_action-charity-hackathon/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6491:\"<p>In 2020, unfazed by the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/2020/charity-hackathons-august-2020-report/\">community organizers rallied together and worked hard to give a WordPress-powered web presence for charities</a> through <a href=\"https://doaction.org/\">online charity hackathons</a>. Our passionate and resilient community members are pulling out all stops this year to continue the good work. We already have two applications for do_action events in the queue, with more in the pipeline! This post aims to encourage all our zealous organizers with tips on how best to organize successful <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/organising-an-online-do_action-event/\">online do_action charity hackathons</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Recruit a core team and prepare an event plan</strong><br />Enlist a team of 5-10 members to wrangle the event. Much like a WordCamp, organizers need to plan do_action events down to the last detail. Make sure you have a plan for the entire event lifecycle &#8211; including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/gathering-non-profits/\">selecting nonprofits</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/getting-particpants/\">finding volunteers</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/finding-sponsors/\">finding sponsors</a>, task management, and execution. For inspiration, check out how the <a href=\"https://github.com/doactionjp/do_action_guideline\">do_action Japan team came up with a plan for the event beforehand</a>! Having a solid communication strategy and setting deadlines is equally important. Finding answers to questions like: “<em>When do volunteer teams meet?”,  “How often should there be check-ins?”,  “How do we track tasks?”,  “How do we measure progress?” </em>and<em> “ What deadlines do we need to meet?” </em>for instance, will help in devising a strategy.</li><li><strong>Finding non-profits and volunteers </strong><br /><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/gathering-non-profits/\">Finding eligible non-profits</a> for your event could be a challenge. When your event publishes the call for non-profits, share it widely on social media. Since this is a charitable event, we have noticed that getting PR from local news media outlets is a lot easier. You might also want to reach out to Non-profit organizations and offer assistance proactively. You can follow the same approach for volunteer recruitment too.</li><li><strong>Fix your collaboration tools and communication strategy<br /></strong>Since this will be an online event, you will need the right collaboration tools to make the event successful. <strong>Please note: A doaction.org G Suite/Google Workspace account will be provided to all do_action event organizers in 2021 and beyond! Feel free to use that account for all your needs. Check out </strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/google-workspace-account-for-do_action-events/\"><strong>the handbook page for more information</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Here are some tools that you can use for your event:<ul><li>doaction.org website (call for nonprofits &amp; hackathon participants)</li><li>Slack (overall event prep, communication on the event days) &#8211; A free plan will be sufficient.</li><li>Zoom (event organizer &amp; inter-team meetings, opening/closing remarks) &#8211; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/special-virtual-events-zoom-request/\">WordPress Community zoom accounts</a> can be used. </li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/google-workspace-account-for-do_action-events/\">Google Workspace tools</a> (provided to all 2021 organizers in the <a href=\"mailto:location@doaction.org\">location@doaction.org</a> format) &#8211; Gmail (inquiries &amp; sponsor communication), Google Forms (call for organizers &amp; sponsors, post-event survey), Google Sheets (task &amp; data management), Google Docs (collaborative editing of documents, Google Drive (for storage needs),  and Google Slides (opening/closing remarks presentation)</li><li>WordPress.com P2 &#8211; for task management</li><li>Trello &#8211; for task management.</li><li>Figma (design)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Finding sponsors<br /></strong>For online do_action events, organizers need not worry about venue or catering expenses. Hence, sponsorship benefits for these events can be passed along directly to non-profits. Most WordPress companies are passionate about supporting non-profits, and providing product/service licenses is a cost-effective way for them to support the community. Consider reaching out to specific companies as per your needs. Sponsorship benefits that do_action events in 2020 had availed include:<ul><li>Free domain and web hosting for non-profits</li><li>Sponsored premium plugins and themes (Only 100% GPL Compliant themes and plugins are allowed)</li><li>Sponsored website services (backups, caching, security, optimization, etc.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Find a way to offer post-event support for non-profit websites<br /></strong>Make sure that once the event is over, each non-profit is trained on how to use and update the site. Perhaps a few volunteers could provide post-event support for a short while (while ensuring that the right expectations are set on both sides). Offering post-event support as a sponsorship benefit could also be a solution to that problem.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Does all of this sound exciting?

The goal was simple: allow users to insert icons nearly anywhere in the block editor at the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin uses version 4.7 of the Font Awesome library out of the box. However, developers can modify this to include custom icon sets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the most useful plugins, it stays in its lane, performing a simple task and doing it well. The plugin presents users with a &ldquo;flag&rdquo; button in the editor toolbar whenever they edit a Rich Text field.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting an icon into a Heading block.\n\n\n\n<p>Rich Text is a block editor component for entering text. Anywhere users can type in the editor canvas is fair game for inserting an icon. This includes paragraphs, headings, image captions, and more. It also extends to blocks from other plugin developers. If they employ a Rich Text field anywhere, the &ldquo;flag&rdquo; button will appear, and users can plop an icon in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Icons inserted through the plugin automatically inherit the surrounding text size. If you stick it in a Heading block, it will grow larger. If you stick it in a Button block, it will match up with the Button text. The same is true for the colors too.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting icons in various blocks at different sizes and colors.\n\n\n\n<p>Because it is impossible to match each theme&rsquo;s design perfectly, some minor spacing or alignment adjustments may be needed. For the most part, the icons looked good when I tested them with various themes. However, there were a couple of one-pixel-off issues and minor alignment miscues with some blocks. On the whole, I did not run into any design-breaking issues. The plugin displayed its icons as it should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One usability issue I encountered was being unable to delete an icon via the <code>Backspace</code> or <code>Delete</code> keys on my keyboard in use with the Buttons block. It worked well with other blocks. The solution for this was to click on the inserted icon. Then, select the &ldquo;flag&rdquo; icon in the toolbar to reopen the inserter. After choosing no replacement, the old one disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin developer provided filter hooks for third-party developers to implement icon sets other than Font Awesome via a custom JSON file. Instructions are outlined in the plugin&rsquo;s readme. There are also hooks for uploading or overwriting the stylesheet and classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I like the plugin&rsquo;s execution, I dislike that it loads its own Font Awesome stylesheet. If using another plugin or theme that does the same, its inclusion increases the page load size for end-users by loading multiple copies of the same code. This is not the fault of the plugin developer. It is a limitation created by WordPress&rsquo;s lack of a dependency system. However, users who give the plugin a try should be mindful of this potential issue.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 23:07:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: Chrome 90 to Use HTTPS by Default in the Address Bar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114269\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:169:\"https://wptavern.com/chrome-90-to-use-https-by-default-in-the-address-bar?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=chrome-90-to-use-https-by-default-in-the-address-bar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2895:\"<p>Chrome&rsquo;s upcoming <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/a-safer-default-for-navigation-https.html\">version 90</a> will use&nbsp;<em>https://</em>&nbsp;by default in the address bar, bringing a significant improvement to security and loading speed. HTTPS adoption has shot up significantly over the past six years after Google&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">announced</a>&nbsp;in 2014 that HTTPS would be used as a ranking signal in search results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, W3Techs found that <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/fact_20210202\">82.2% of websites use a valid SSL certificate</a>. Today, more than <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en\">98% of pages loaded in Chrome</a> use HTTPS as the default protocol, making this change to using HTTPS as the default for navigations long overdue. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefox Telemetry charts HTTPS adoption at <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads\">more than 84%</a> of web pages for all users and 92% for traffic originating in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, anytime a user puts a site into the address bar without specifying the protocol, such as &ldquo;example.com,&rdquo; Chrome uses HTTP by default and then has to retry for HTTPS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update in Chrome 90 is good news for Chrome users, because it improves the loading speed for sites that support HTTPS by cutting out the redirection loop after the initial load. A gif on the Chromium blog illustrates this in a nice way: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who are using Chrome Canary can access experiments to try it out ahead of the version 90 release. Navigate to the following URL to mark the experimental feature as enabled:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>chrome://flags/#omnibox-default-typed-navigations-to-https</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress site owners will want to make sure their sites are using HTTPS in order to take advantage of the speed boost this change introduces. Fortunately, for those who haven&rsquo;t migrated over yet, the latest <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-7-will-make-it-easier-to-migrate-from-http-to-https\">5.7 release makes it easy to update with the click of a button</a>. WordPress can detect if the site&rsquo;s hosting environment supports HTTPS and then offers a one-click update process via the Site Health screen. It even handles mixed content rewrites where possible, so site owners will not have to worry about having a bunch of broken links after migrating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chrome 90 went into beta in mid-March. The stable release is <a href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule\">scheduled</a> for 20 days following beta on April 13, 2021.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 17:28:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"HeroPress: My Journey From Freelancer To Product Maker\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3513\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:160:\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-journey-from-freelancer-to-product-maker/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=my-journey-from-freelancer-to-product-maker\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9826:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/032321-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: The WordPress community is integral for its success and I can\'t thank it enough.\" /><p>Like many others in our industry, my WordPress journey started a while ago.</p>\n<p>I built my first website using GeoCities when I was 14 years old, 21 years ago (boy am I getting old). At the time I was obsessed with skateboarding, the website was for friends I used to hang out and ride around with from school. I remember how excited I felt when I could see that my website was online and I would literally show it to everyone I could, even though looking back at it now it was extremely brightly coloured and scrappy!</p>\n<p>Back then, with my family&#8217;s 56k connection, whenever I connected to the internet it would take over the landline, so I was only allowed to go online for an hour per day. So I spent the days fiddling with Front Page, just waiting for my 1 hour to upload the code and share the updates with my MIRC friends (kinda like a Stone Age version of Slack).</p>\n<p>That’s about the time I also picked up a guitar for the first time&#8230;.</p>\n<h3>Music, business and websites</h3>\n<p>To start I borrowed a super cheap electric guitar from a friend to learn how to play, and impress a girl I liked. After playing all evening, I felt so inspired that the guitar ended up next to me while I slept in bed. It was love at first chord.</p>\n<p>Because I was so obsessed, I couldn’t stop practicing and quickly I became pretty good (for a kid). So much so that I formed a band with some friends and started performing wherever we could. For the next decade, I focused on becoming the best rock musician I could.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to just play the guitar in a band that was performing at local events and school, I wanted us to go places and started treating it as a business. I began studying business by reading every book I could, which led me to take courses and become a certified business and digital consultant.</p>\n<p>During my studies, I learned WordPress and the entire Adobe suite. This was my first introduction to WordPress and it made me love designing and developing websites even more than I already did.</p>\n<p>I had fun during this time, but they were some tough years and despite all of my efforts, my band wasn’t doing very well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After everything I had put into it, I thought I’d have my own episode on MTV Cribs already!</p></blockquote>\n<p>We decided the band needed a change.</p>\n<p>We rebranded, wrote new stuff, this time in English to maximise our reach, and did an online launch using everything I learned.</p>\n<p>Within a month of the launch, my local band from a small town in Israel was signed to release an album worldwide through a British label.</p>\n<p>We were stoked!</p>\n<p>We decided to drop everything, come to the UK and start touring Europe. And so we did!</p>\n<p>Starting from scratch, we began building our audience at small venues and pubs, while really pumping things up online, using WordPress to build our website and promote!</p>\n<p>We went from playing to sometimes less than 10 people to hundreds, then thousands. Playing with some of the artists we grew up listening to.</p>\n<p>It was pretty amazing, but I was still broke surprisingly!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image1.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Luckily though, from my efforts in promoting the band using our website and designs on social media, my work began to get noticed and I started to attract clients.</p>\n<p>With little to no money in my bank account, I started freelancing out the back of our tour van and built clients websites while touring Europe. Free McDonalds WiFi became my best friend and no matter where we went, there was always one nearby.</p>\n<p>While I drew in more clients and started generating revenue for myself, unfortunately my band ended up splitting up. It was unavoidable and in the end, it was the best thing that could have happened to me (even though it was devastating at the time).</p>\n<p>I then thought, “you know what, I’m going to start taking this freelancing thing seriously.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started building my own business, using my rediscovered passion for the web and WordPress in particular.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As I got deeper into building websites, I began to insert myself more into the WordPress community, which filled the void of being “the band guy”. As my time now wasn’t being taken up by touring, I employed my first designer and this is where my agency took off.</p>\n<p>We managed to pull in 6 figures within the first year, and we kept growing!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image2.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Within a few years, my agency grew to 12 employees. As I acquired more clients, I realized there was something holding me back.</p>\n<h3>From Agency To Product Maker</h3>\n<p>As we began dealing with more and more clients day-to-day, it became blindingly apparent that we simply did not have the correct tools to deal with the volume efficiently.</p>\n<p>So, I went on the hunt for a platform or tool that could help organize and deal with client requests quickly and easily. We already had a ticketing system in place, while using emails, phone calls and face to face meetings, but it was just all a mess.</p>\n<p>There are solutions to the problems of project management BUT I struggled to find a purely dedicated platform that was for a web design agency.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I arranged a meeting with my team and we decided, let’s just build our own solution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We had the designers and developers to make it happen, so&#8230;we did! We developed a simple WordPress plugin that we could use to take requests from our clients across all of their websites, and after it was implemented, it worked like a dream.</p>\n<p>Being the person I am though, I didn’t stop there. I thought, “other people should be using this” and that’s where my product, Atarim, was born. I reached out to the WordPress community wherever I could and got a bunch of beta testers to try it out with their own clients.</p>\n<p>The feedback was so positive that we developed the plugin even further and started charging monthly and annual plans for other agencies and freelancers to start using it. We are now a fully fledged agency management platform serving thousands of freelancers and agencies and helped deliver tens of thousands of website projects. In just short of two years.</p>\n<p>Now we only deal with a couple of legacy clients who have been with us for a while, and we use our own platform to manage them.</p>\n<h3>The WP Community</h3>\n<p>I’ve been part of the WordPress community for a long time now, and I’m humbled and honored to say that without it, my product would not be where it is today.</p>\n<p>Before COVID, I was a regular at every event I could get to, whether it was in London (where I live) or another country.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve made some lifelong friends within the community and it has made working day-to-day an absolute blast</p></blockquote>\n<p>…(obviously with some major stresses in between, but hey you aren’t doing it right if you aren’t stressed most of the time!).</p>\n<p>Because of COVID though, I was driven to creating our own event online. Last year we had our first and we are currently gearing up for the second one to go live very soon!</p>\n<p>The Atarim Web Agency Summit was born out of love for the WordPress Community. An online event that spans 4 days where we can all come together and listen to some of the greatest minds in our industry talk about their craft and how we can improve our agencies and freelance businesses.</p>\n<p>We managed to develop the summit into the biggest online event in the WordPress space and it was incredibly humbling to partner with some of the largest companies and famous speakers. Companies that have products I myself have been using for years, and speakers that I used to watch on YouTube!</p>\n<p>Also, the feedback we received from our initial beta test and the feedback we continue to get from our current users, helps shape the product every single day. The WordPress community is integral for it’s success and I can’t thank it enough.</p>\n<p>I love that our platform is helping agencies and freelancers that are experiencing the exact same stresses and problems I was facing when growing my agency. This is what drives my team and I to continue working and evolving Atarim, until it is the only way to manage website projects.</p>\n<h3>What’s Next?</h3>\n<p>Next, I want to make our platform accessible on any type of website, whether it’s WordPress, Drupal, Shopify or built purely from custom HTML &amp; CSS. I want Atarim to be accessible to any type of agency owner and freelancer so they can implement our platform and reap the benefits.</p>\n<p>I’m continuing to build the team as our product gets more and more users, so we can up development on a weekly basis and release updates that enhance the experience for our current and bring in new users.</p>\n<p>As for me personally, I’m learning new and exciting things every day, attending courses and webinars where I can to ensure that I’m doing the best I can to steer Atarim in the right direction. I’ve been at this for nearly 2 years now, the plan is to go for another 8 years and re-evaluate from there.</p>\n<p>I’m excited for the future!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-journey-from-freelancer-to-product-maker/\">My Journey From Freelancer To Product Maker</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 08:01:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Vito Peleg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Eksell Portfolio Theme Now Available in WordPress Themes Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114120\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:197:\"https://wptavern.com/eksell-portfolio-theme-now-available-in-wordpress-themes-directory?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=eksell-portfolio-theme-now-available-in-wordpress-themes-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2805:\"<p>Anders Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/eksell/\">Eksell theme</a> is now available for download from the WordPress Themes directory.

There are now 12 block patterns that help users create stacked galleries, calls to action, multiple columns with pullquotes, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Eksell also includes a unique &ldquo;<a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/eksell/blank-canvas/\">Blank Canvas</a>&rdquo; page template that only displays content added in the block editor, which Nor&eacute;n said offers a preview of what users will be able to do once Full Site Editing (FSE) is merged into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.andersnoren.se/introducing-eksell/\">Eksell announcement post</a> is a sobering reminder of the uncertainty facing even the most experienced theme developers with changes coming later this year. Nor&eacute;n said he is not planning to update his existing 20 themes to support FSE:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>My current belief is that I won&rsquo;t update my existing themes to take advantage of Full Site Editing. Not because I don&rsquo;t buy into the vision of Full Site Editing, but because I don&rsquo;t think anyone would be well-served by six year old themes (like Hoffman) very much not built for FSE being updated to sorta-kinda support it. I would rather spend that time on themes built from the ground up to take advantage of the new tools Full Site Editing gives us.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Once FSE is released, Nor&eacute;n said themes not updated to support it will immediately feel outdated &ldquo;much like Classic Editor themes felt in the spring of 2019.&rdquo; Theme developers don&rsquo;t yet know what shape themes will take or how difficult it may be to update them once FSE is in core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nor&eacute;n is considering updating Eksell to bridge the gap between the world before FSE and whatever themes look like after it lands in core, but reserved the right to leave it behind with the others. For the time being, it is one of the best themes around for the block editor, but it may be the last of the truly classic themes before the dawn of a new era in theming.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 01:28:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Refactoring Gutenberg’s Gallery Block To Support Nested Images\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=114179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:187:\"https://wptavern.com/refactoring-gutenbergs-gallery-block-to-support-nested-images?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=refactoring-gutenbergs-gallery-block-to-support-nested-images\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4957:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Like many others, I often have pinned tabs of all sorts of things in my browser. Some of them linger there for months. Others for years, I shamefully admit. Of the handful of Gutenberg-related browser tabs I have had <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25940\">pinned since late 2020</a>, one of them finally had the sort of movement I have been waiting on. The Gallery block was finally getting the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/23/gallery-block-update-call-for-testing/\">much-needed refactor</a> it needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A gallery is essentially a container with nested images. The concept of nested blocks has existed and has been in use for a long while now. However, the core Gallery block does not make use of this capability. This means that users have no access to existing Image block features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to customize the link for individual images?</em> No can do with the Gallery block. Instead, users must use Columns and drop Image blocks in. It is such a fundamentally broken part of the user experience there is little wonder that users have looked outside of core WordPress for alternative solutions. And it has been a problem since the introduction of galleries via the shortcode system in WordPress 2.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to alternate styles for each image in the gallery?</em> That has traditionally been impossible too. However, when each image is an Image block, users can alternate between square and round styles, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Alternating Image block styles in a Gallery.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can even use a plugin like Editor Plus with its extended Image block styles to create a Gallery of &ldquo;image blobs&rdquo; or animate them individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Individual images with &ldquo;blob&rdquo; shapes via Editor Plus.\n\n\n\n<p>This change could open some layout possibilities where users control the positioning of each item in the grid. And, why stop with images? There is no reason that core could not open the block up to other types of nesting in the future, such as videos, quotes, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Gallery of images with a quote.\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to this new feature is that it could require more work from developers who have already built on top of the Gallery block. That is why it is fundamental that they test this change now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testers can see the change by switching to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/25940\">gallery refactor branch</a> via GitHub or grab a <a href=\"https://glendaviesnz.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/gutenberg-gallery-refactor-1.zip\">ZIP file</a> of the build. It adds a new &ldquo;Gallery Refactor&rdquo; option to Gutenberg&rsquo;s Experimental setting screen, which must be enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only newly-added Gallery blocks will use the new format. Nothing changed about it at first glance. However, by selecting an individual image, users can use the typical Image block settings. The two exceptions are the align and resize options, removed because they would break the layout. New galleries also do not work in the site editor yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While the expectation is nothing changes in terms of output, this is a pretty major change on a technical level for a very popular block, so it&rsquo;d be a huge help to gather as much testing feedback as possible,&rdquo; wrote Glen Davies in the announcement post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This statement could be misleading. There are fundamental, backward-incompatible changes to the markup output with the new implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous iterations of the gallery, it had a wrapper container (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) and an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) of images. The proposed change would remove the list entirely, dropping the Image blocks as direct children of the containing element. This will break custom theme styles and potentially plugin integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a technical level, I do not see the need to change the outer markup galleries. It is only the image part of the equation that needs to change. If this is because of limitations with the <code>InnerBlocks</code> system (nested blocks feature), perhaps it is not robust enough to meet developers&rsquo; needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With continual breaking changes to markup and CSS in the core block system, coding the entirety of a site&rsquo;s CSS from scratch is probably a thing of the past. This is not the first instance of such breakage and will undoubtedly be the last, a rarity in the pre-block era. The best course of action is for theme authors to leave core styles in place and extend them, even if it means some bloat for page loads. It is not a fool-proof plan, but it lightens the burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I welcome the Gallery block enhancement, even it breaks a few things. It potentially opens a world of possibilities and is necessary if the project ever wants to provide end-users with anything other than super basic functionality.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 17:39:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 14:53:45 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 14:45:08 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172007\";}', 'no');
